<p>Have a few brief thoughts on this whole Bin Laden kerfluffle that are too long for <a href="http://twitter.com/oddevan">twitter</a>, so here goes.</p>

<ul>
<li>At the Phillies/Mets game the news broke in the bottom of the 8th, prompting a spontaneous chant of "USA! USA!" that got the crowd excited and utterly confused the players. Why one of the players didn't turn around and ask someone in the stands is beyond me (unless there's an MLB rule against it or something).</li>
<li>There's lots of scripture being tossed around twitter right now. Most of it is a variation of God not taking pleasure in the death of the wicked, but there is also the occasional "when the wicked perish there are shouts of joy."</li>
<li>The most balanced take so far is probably <a href="https://twitter.com/derekwebb/status/64895198542573568">Derek Webb's</a>:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>don't celebrate death, celebrate justice</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now I should get back to work.</p>
