I like Owl City. [This is independent of my appreciation for Owl City.][appreciate] At their best, Owl City has a tendency to take me back to the late nights in my humid converted-attic bedroom the summer before my sophomore year of high school. To sum up a thousand-word essay in a sentence, it was the summer I really started letting my imagination free. Needless to say, it was a very formative ten weeks.

By that measure, Owl City's new EP _Ultraviolet_ does not disappoint.

The first track, "Beautiful Times," features [Lindsey Stirling][lindsey] on the violin. The music is full, lush, and steady, matching the song's patiently optimistic lyrics. Lindsey's violin helps drive home the song's theme of seeing even a "fight of my life" being "beautiful times." It's followed by "Up All Night," an infectious dance song that seems to be about a missed connection, though anyone that's had a person (or other thing) on their mind for an extended length of time can relate. 

The third track, "This Isn't the End," deals with heavy issues including suicide, panic attacks, and abandonment. It was hard for me, personally, to see past those issues enough to judge the song musically, though it does seem to be the weakest song in the set.

The selling point of the EP for me is the last track, "Wolf Bite." Like Owl City's first mega-hit "Fireflies," the song has a bit of a musical dichotomy: while the words seem to belong to a quiet, understated song, the music apparently thinks otherwise. This is something Adam himself [lampshaded on his blog][title-ref]:

> Spoiler: Owl City is 95% sad lyrics over uplifting chords.

Unlike "Fireflies," however, I think the dichotomy is warranted on this song. While "Fireflies" is a song about being unable to sleep (and things getting _weirder_ as a result!), "Wolf Bite" is a call for help. Instead of the focus of the song being inward, the focus is outward toward another, calling out to "show me the way." In other words, if you get one song off this EP, get this one.
