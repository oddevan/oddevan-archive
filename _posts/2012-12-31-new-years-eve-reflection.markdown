<p><a href="http://latenightdramaqueen.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Brittany</a> does this every year, and it’s a good idea.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>What was the single best thing that happened this past year?</strong> Mountcation 2012. It was nice to remember that we could actually get out and enjoy life some.</li>
<li><strong>What was the single most challenging thing that happened?</strong> Brittany’s dad passed away this year. This has affected both of us more than we realize.</li>
<li><strong>What was an unexpected joy this past year?</strong> Being surprised by just how much my wife loves me.</li>
<li><strong>What was an unexpected obstacle?</strong> Seeing the possibility of me losing my job but having to put aside the stress and work hard(er) anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Pick three words to describe 2012.</strong> The long game.</li>
<li><strong>Pick three words your spouse would use to describe your 2012 (don’t ask them; guess based on how you think your spouse sees you).</strong> Growing and maturing.</li>
<li><strong>Pick three words your spouse would use to describe their 2012 (again, without asking).</strong> Victories and trials.</li>
<li><strong>What were the best books you read this year?</strong> Didn’t read many books, but I did finally get around to starting the <em>Dragonriders of Pern</em> series.</li>
<li><strong>With whom were your most valuable relationships?</strong> Brittany and my family (though I need to work on the second more).</li>
<li><strong>What was your biggest personal change from January to December of this past year?</strong> I’ve re-learned that things don’t just happen; you have to do them. To wit, “if you were the inventor of Facebook, you would have invented Facebook.”</li>
<li><strong>In what way(s) did you grow emotionally?</strong> See previous. I’ve spent less time spinning my wheels wishing for life to change and more time trying to change it.</li>
<li><strong>In what way(s) did you grow spiritually?</strong> I’m recognizing my need for God, but I need to spend more time seeking Him.</li>
<li><strong>In what way(s) did you grow physically?</strong> I HAVE A BIG HEAD AND LITTLE ARMS.</li>
<li><strong>In what way(s) did you grow in your relationships with others?</strong> Trying to talk less and listen more.</li>
<li><strong>What was the most enjoyable part of your work (both professionally and at home)?</strong> I spent about two weeks on a side project that has netted me at least a week in saved time/energy. It was fun to get back into the mode of solving problems.</li>
<li><strong>What was the most challenging part of your work (both professionally and at home)?</strong> Showing up and doing good work even when I don’t want to.</li>
<li><strong>What was your single biggest time waster in your life this past year?</strong> Stress and/or escape.</li>
<li><strong>What was the best way you used your time this past year?</strong> Working on bettering myself and working on my marriage.</li>
<li><strong>What was biggest thing you learned this past year?</strong> It will not “just work;” I need to make it work.</li>
<li><strong>Create a phrase or statement that describes 2012 for you.</strong> S#!% just got real.</li>
</ol>

<p>See you guys next year!</p>
