There's a lot of talk about ditching cable and using streaming services instead to get your entertainment. Here's our master list of options. This is for US-centric audiences; viewers in other countries will have other options.

*Note:* As more services start up or shut down, we will keep this guide updated accordingly. [The full revision history is on GitHub.](https://github.com/oddevan/oddevan.github.io/commits/master/newtv.md)

## Modern Cable Family ##

These services act like traditional cable/satellite providers, except they use the internet instead of physical cables. This allows them to offer traditional cable channels like TNT and TBS, showing the same shows at the same time.

### [Sling](http://slingtv.com/) ###

Sling is pretty awesome, at least on paper. It's the only service on this list that provides access to ESPN and its related networks. The basic package has 23 channels including ESPN, TNT, A&E, AMC, and Food Network. Other channels like DIY Network, Epix, HBO, and Cinemax are available in micro-bundles. While it's not quite a-la-carte cable channels, it's the closest we've seen yet. It does not have any DVR functionality, but it offers most networks' programming on-demand.

Sling does not currently have broadcast networks nationwide. Viewers in some select cities can get a broadcast add-on that includes ABC.

**Cost:** $20/month for basic package; add-on bundles from $5-15/month

### [PlayStation Vue](https://www.playstationnetwork.com/vue/) ###

PlayStation Vue is a service from Sony that closely mimics a traditional cable subscription. It includes many of the channels traditionally found in a cable package, but is priced accordingly. Unlike Sling, it includes most local broadcast channels and regional sports networks, and it offers a DVR. Unlike Sling, it does not include any Disney-owned channels, including ESPN.

Because it includes local channels, it is only available in select markets.

**Access package:** $50/month
**Core package:** $55/month
**Elite package:** $65/month

### [Showtime](http://www.showtime.com/) ###

Showtime is unique on this list as it is the only standalone channel that offers both a live simulcast of the traditional Showtime channel in addition to on-demand access. If you subscribe to Amazon Prime, Hulu, or PlayStation Vue, you can also add Showtime to your subscription, sometimes for less.

**Through Amazon Prime or Hulu:** $9/month
**Through Vue or standalone app:** $11/month

## Recorded programs ##

These options are what most people think of when cutting cable. Subscribing to one of these services will let you watch any show or movie in their library at any time you want. The libraries can change over time, and all the services have their own exclusive shows.

Because you can start a show any time you want, these services don't have any live broadcasts (such as sporting events). 

### [Netflix](http://netflix.com/) ###

The granddaddy of them all. The one to watch. The new HBO. An enormous catalog of TV shows and movies. While their licensed catalog is ever-changing (so long, _Doctor Who_), they have a growing stable of original series that are generally well-liked. If you're not already a subscriber, someone you know probably is.

**Standard:** $8/month
**High Definition:** $10/month
**4K Video[^nf4k]:** $12/month

[^nf4k]: 4K video is higher than High Definition. To get it from Netflix, you need an ISP that has an arrangement with Netflix to carry the video, a high enough plan from said ISP to deliver the video to your house, and a TV capable of displaying said video. It's pretty much exclusively for early adopters.

### [HBO Now](https://order.hbonow.com) ###

HBO, Netflix-style. Watch shows from HBO's extensive catalog on-demand. New episodes are posted the same time they are broadcast on the traditional HBO channel. Due to how HBO is set up, you will likely need to sign up through an app. (If having the live HBO channel is important to you, the HBO add-on through Sling is the same price.)

**Cost:** $15/month

### [Amazon Prime Instant Video](http://www.amazon.com/instantvideo) ###

In addition to free two-day shipping, a Prime subscription also comes with free access to a selection of movies and TV shows, including some new original series. The catch? Amazon also maintains a pay-per-view library that is far more extensive, so a positive search result does not always mean a free viewing.

**Cost:** $100/year as part of Amazon Prime

### [Hulu](http://hulu.com/) ###

Hulu is actually owned by several of the broadcast networks that give it content, allowing it to get many TV shows the day after they air. There is limited free access through the website, but a subscription will open up more shows as well as access through TV and smartphone apps. Please note that the standard option includes commercial interruptions during shows.

**Standard:** $8/month
**Commercial-free:** $12/month

### [Seeso](https://www.seeso.com) ###

A new comedy-focused service from NBC. It's different from the other options here: instead of a broad library for around $10, it offers a curated comedy library for less than $5. They have a number of exclusive and original stand-up specials and series as well as complete catalogs of comedy series like _30 Rock_, _Parks and Recreation_, and _Monty Python's Flying Circus._

**Cost:** $4/month

## Sports! ##

The major sports leagues often have their own services. Pay attention to blackouts, though; these services often offer "out-of-market" games, so if one of the teams is your "local" team (or if the game is being broadcast on a national network), you won't be able to watch the game. The prices we have listed are the full-season prices; leagues will often lower the price as the season progresses.

### [ESPN 3](http://espn3.com) ###

ESPN 3 is basically a catch-all service that shows every event coming into ESPN's main hub, including some out-of-market events from other networks. Replays of past events are also available to stream on-demand. Expect lots of second-tier college sports. Events broadcast on any of the ESPN channels or on a regional sports network are usually blacked out. Most replays are not subject to blackout, though.

If you have a participating internet service provider, an ESPN 3 subscription is included. If you want to access through the WatchESPN or ESPN apps, you will need a television subscription. Fortunately, this includes Sling.

### [MLB.tv](http://mlb.tv) ###

The granddaddy of them all. Major League Baseball has gotten so good at streaming live events to lots of people, their technology actually powers other networks on this list, including HBO. Plus, their apps are consistently best-in-class. With baseball games happening pretty much every day of the season, there's bound to be something on.

**Cost:** $120/year

### [Fox Soccer 2 Go](http://www.foxsoccer2go.com) ###

A service from Fox Sports that showcases many European league games. If you're a soccer fanatic, this could be worth it, but with no MLS or Premier League, it's a harder sell.

**Monthly subscription:** $20/month
**Annual subscription:** $140/year

### Other Sports Networks ###

	- **Single Game:** $7/each
	- **Team Access:** $60/year
