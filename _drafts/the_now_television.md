About a year ago, I wrote [an article speculating what the television landscape could look like 5-10 years from now][newtv]. In that article, I didn't address the possibility of an "internet cable" company, where a company offers a service nearly indistinguishable from traditional cable but delivered over the internet. [I asked about such a company on Quora once,][quora] and the response was basically, "Even if you won the lottery, you couldn't do this." So I considered it impossible and dismissed it.

[Then the impossible happened.][introducing-sling] [Then it happened again.][introducing-psvue] [Then "never in a million years" happened.][introducing-hbonow]

Suddenly the future looks a lot less hypothetical. Let's explore, shall we?

### Vue Your Local PlayStation ###

### The Sling Shot ###

Now, to be fair, this isn't a fresh startup as I had actually asked about. Sling Television is owned by Dish Network, the satellite provider most known for being cheaper than DIRECTV. In more recent years, they've competed on customer-friendly features like the Hopper DVR that, among other things, can automatically record every major network at once. The latest version, the Hopper with Sling, contains a built-in [Slingbox][slingbox] that allows a customer to send any channel in their subscription to their phone or tablet.
