<p>So the genius behind <a href="http://www.xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> just <a href="http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/02/04/limerickdbcom/">opened up</a> <a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/">LimerickDB</a>. Be warned, many (if not most) are definitely <abbr title="Not Safe For Work/Kids/Sensitive People"><span class="caps">NSFW</span></abbr>, but I find many of them quite clever, which I have repeated below.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?286">#286</a><br />

There once was a buggy AI<br />

Who decided her subject should die.<br />

When the plot was uncovered,<br />

The subjected discovered<br />

That sadly the cake was a lie.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?34">#34</a><br />

A woman in liquor production<br />

Owns a still of exquisite construction.<br />

The alcohol boils<br />

Through magnetic coils.<br />

She says that it’s “proof by induction.”</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?292">#292</a><br />

A preoccupied vegan named Hugh<br />

picked up the wrong sandwich to chew.<br />

He took a big bite<br />

before spitting, in fright,<br />

“OMG, <span class="caps">WTF</span>, <span class="caps">BBQ</span>!”</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?257">#257</a><br />

There once was a small juicy orange,<br />

…f–k.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?107">#107</a><br />

See that lighthouse beam in the sky<br />

That guides yonder ships going by?<br />

My friend shines that beam;<br />

She’s living her dream.<br />

I’m in grad school. I still don’t know why.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?21">#21</a><br />

There was a young woman named Bright<br />

Whose speed was much faster than light.<br />

She set out one day<br />

In a relative way,<br />

And returned on the previous night.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?282">#282</a><br />

A programmer started to cuss<br />

Because getting to sleep was a fuss<br />

As he lay there in bed<br />

Looping ’round in his head<br />

was: while(!asleep()) sheep++;</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?119">#119</a><br />

The limerick’s structure somewhat<br />

necessitates <strong>eloquent</strong> smut.<br />

If you haven’t the time<br />

to learn meter and rhyme,<br />

then don’t write them, you ignorant s–t.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?177">#177</a><br />

There once was a girl named Lenore<br />

And a bird and a bust and a door<br />

And a guy with depression<br />

And a whole lot of questions<br />

And the bird always says “Nevermore.”</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?11">#11</a><br />

There once was a man from Japan<br />

whose limericks just wouldn’t scan.<br />

When asked why this was,<br />

he answered, “Because<br />

I always cram as many syllables into the last line as I possibly can.”</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?22">#22</a><br />

There once was a maid from Madras<br />

Who had a magnificent ass.<br />

Not rounded and pink,<br />

as you’d possibly think;<br />

It was gray, had long ears, and ate grass.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?12">#12</a><br />

There once was a gal from Peru<br />

whose limericks stopped on line two.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?189">#189</a><br />

There was a zookeep from Nantucket<br />

Who was struck by a fish — couldn’t duck it<br />

He was thrown from the cage<br />

By a pinniped’s rage.<br />

Quoth the walrus, “You can’t has mah bukkit!”</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?109">#109</a><br />

A newspaper poet for Hearst<br />

Deprived of his reason<br />

By uncontrolled sneezing<br />

Was by phantasmal demons coerced<br />

To write all of his limericks reversed.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?2">#2</a><br />

The limerick packs laughs astronomical<br />

in a space that is most economical.<br />

But of the ones that I’ve seen,<br />

so few have been clean,<br />

and the clean ones are seldom so comical.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?77">#77</a><br />

A dozen, a gross, and a score<br />

plus three times the square root of four<br />

divided by seven<br />

plus five times eleven<br />

is nine squared, and not a bit more!</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?95">#111</a><br />

There once was a fellow from Xiangling<br />

Whose greatest delight was in mangling<br />

Poems. He would drop<br />

Words between lines and lop<br />

Their ends off, and leave readers dang</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?333">#333</a><br />

There was a limerick I heard,<br />

With stressed syllables quite awkward.<br />

Rhythm was somewhat<br />

Still present in it, but<br />

It forced mispronouncing every word.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?290">#290</a><br />

To the skeptics I say, oh come off it.<br />

Your aluminum hat? You can doff it.<br />

To me it’s a riddle<br />

Just what’s in the middle<br />

But I’m sure that the last step is profit.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?127">#127</a><br />

There once was a girl named Jude,<br />

Who’s skirt by the wind was strewed.<br />

A man came along,<br />

And unless im quite wrong,<br />

You expected this last line to be lewd.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?271">#271</a><br />

Ther once was an old man of Esser,<br />

Whose knowledge grew lesser and lesser,<br />

It at last grew so small<br />

He knew nothing at all,<br />

And now he’s a college professor.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?145">#145</a><br />

A student as smart as could be<br />

Had to integrate x to the 3<br />

He said “x to the 4<br />

over 4, I am sure”<br />

But was off by a constant of C.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?355">#355</a><br />

Since your poems are clumsy and s–te,<br />

No longer can I be polite:<br />

Come on you f–ktard,<br />

It’s really not hard,<br />

to get the d–n syllables right.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?65">#65</a><br />

A poet ran out of ideas;<br />

Because he had no more ideas;<br />

He repeated himself,<br />

By repeating himself,<br />

Because he ran out of ideas;</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?277">#277</a><br />

Two eager and dashing young beaux<br />

Were held up and robbed of their cleaux<br />

In summer it’s warm -<br />

They’ll come to no harm<br />

But what will they do if it sneaux?</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?131">#131</a><br />

There was a young man who said “God<br />

Must find it exceedingly odd<br />

To think that the tree<br />

Should continue to be<br />

When there’s no one about in the quad.”</p>



<p>“Dear Sir: Your astonishment’s odd;<br />

I am always about in the quad.<br />

And that’s why the tree<br />

Will continue to be<br />

Since observed by, Yours faithfully, God.”</p>



<p><a href="http://www.limerickdb.com/?264">#264</a><br />

There once was a poet named Gunderson<br />

Whose rhyme schemes were all very cumbersome.<br />

With each botched refrain,<br />

he’d be heard to exclaim,<br />

“Oh, how do I get myself into these situations?!</p>
