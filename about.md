<p>My name is <a href="http://eph.me/">Evan Hildreth</a>, and I'm a big-picture analyst. That's not a job description; that's my personality. I love seeing how technology and creativity intersect, and sometimes I feel excited enough to write about it.</p>

<p>So, most importantly, thank you for reading.</p>

<p>For those who care: This site is published with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> running on my <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/17/4436332/macbook-air-review-13-inch-2013">2013 MacBook Air</a>.
