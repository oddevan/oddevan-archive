I appreciate a lot of things, and I like a lot of things. They are not necessarily the same things.

In my personal dictionary, when I appreciate something it is usually on its more concrete qualities. I appreciate the workmanship of a well-built desk. I appreciate the fuel efficiency of a moped. I appreciate the cuss out of [my laptop's battery life][mba]. These are all quantifiable qualities: I can back up my appreciation with numbers and comparisons.

I also appreciate less-quantifiable things. I appreciate the way an illustrator uses facial expressions to convey emotion. I appreciate an author's use of language to set a mood. I appreciate a composer's ability to weave chords and melody together and a [drummer's ability to play the cuss out of some drums][dkdrummer]. These things are less quantifiable but still concrete to some extant.

All of these things add up to a healthy appreciation for something, and that is usually the biggest factor into whether I will recommend something for general consumption.

But it doesn't mean I _like_ it.

To me, liking something means I can connect with it on an emotional level. This connection is usually dependent on very personal factors: my temperament, my experiences, my ideals. Something I like will often remind me of or awaken in me a strong, unfulfilled desire for _something_, and it almost always ends up inspiring my imagination to go to new places.

It's hard for me to recommend things on this basis alone. Usually if I like something, I'll say things like "It's not for everyone" or "Your mileage may vary." I'm well aware of the personal nature of my feelings, and it's hard to justify a recommendation simply based on that.

Maybe it's a confidence problem: I'm not sure enough in my own taste to confidently recommend something. Maybe it's a language issue, and I need to figure out the right words to use to differentiate my feelings. Or maybe it's a false dichotomy, and I simply need to accept the fact that as a complex human being my opinions can be equally complex.

Maybe I just need to appreciate that I don't always know why I like something.
