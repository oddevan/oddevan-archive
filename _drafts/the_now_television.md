About a year ago, I wrote [an article speculating what the television landscape could look like 5-10 years from now][newtv]. In that article, I didn't address the possibility of an "internet cable" company, where a company offers a service nearly indistinguishable from traditional cable but delivered over the internet. [I asked about such a company on Quora once,][quora] and the response was basically, "Even if you won the lottery, you couldn't do this." So I considered it impossible and dismissed it.

[Then the impossible happened.][introducing-sling]

Suddenly the future looks a lot less hypothetical. Here's how the newcomer Sling fits into the current (and near future) TV landscape, and why I'm suddenly more hopeful than ever about the future of the medium.

### Versus Netflix ###

Wait, are they supposed to be competing?

Netflix is positioning itself as on-demand only, and they're sticking to it. [Reed Hastings has repeatedly portrayed scheduled television as the past.][reed-hbo-linear] With Sling focusing on live and scheduled TV as its selling point, the two companies seem ideologically opposed. Yet both companies focus on the best of live or on-demand: Sling touts the ability to watch live sports on ESPN, and Netflix offers entire seasons of its hit shows to watch on any schedule.

Hastings would have us believe Netflix and Sling are like oil and water, but I see them more as chocolate and peanut butter.[^stfu]

[^stfu]: Because shut up, chocolate and peanut butter are awesome together.

### The Sling Shot ###

Now, to be fair, Sling TV isn't a fresh startup as I had actually asked about. Sling Television is owned by Dish Network, the satellite provider most known for being cheaper than DIRECTV. In more recent years, they've competed on customer-friendly features like the Hopper DVR that, among other things, can automatically record every major network at once. The latest version, the Hopper with Sling, contains a built-in [Slingbox][slingbox] that allows a customer to send any channel in their subscription to their phone or tablet.
