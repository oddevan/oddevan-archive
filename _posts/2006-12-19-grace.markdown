<p>Grace.</p>

<p>It’s a wonderful feeling, really. Getting what you don’t deserve. I guess that’s the lesson I had to learn. See, I was saved as a small child. There was never any one moment I can point to and say &#8220;There’s my epiphany; that’s where I first experienced Grace!&#8221; For me it’s been more of a slow realization, a gradual increase in knowledge of Grace. Well, I just got my biggest shot of it.</p>

<blockquote>
        <p>CS-30: B<br />
CS-38: A-<br />
<span class="caps">HST</span>-A55: B<br />
<strong>Cumulative Grade Point Average: 3.011</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means I get to keep my Furman Scholarships</p>

<p>In all honesty, I don’t know how this is true. I’m fully expecting my mom to get an e-mail tomorrow that says there was a mistake and I got a D in CS-30. But what really interests me is how by mid-term I had — and still have — accepted the fact that my grades won’t be what I want them to be. I’m going to lose financial aid. God has a plan and I have to work with it. For a while I thought that plan was for me to stay at Furman, even if it meant incurring a little debt. The friendships I’ve made there and the <strong>real-world experience</strong> I’m getting outside of class are worth the price.</p>

<p>And now this. I may not have to go into mountains of debt after all. That, my friends, is grace. And it’s helping me see what Grace really is. Amen?</p>
