Here we go again with another New Year's Introspection!

1. **What was the single best thing that happened this past year?** [Attending Grok 2014](http://www.oddevan.com/to-learn-and-understand/)
2. **What was the single most challenging thing that happened?** Learning to deal with the pain of regret and disappointment on a bigger scale than I thought I'd experience.
3. **What was an unexpected joy this past year?** [Giving my new camera a workout.](http://www.flickr.com/oddevan)
4. **What was an unexpected obstacle?** See #2.
5. **Pick three words to describe 2014.** Finding our equilibrium.
6. **Pick three words your spouse would use to describe your 2014 (don’t ask them; guess based on how you think your spouse sees you).** Highs and lows
7. **Pick three words your spouse would use to describe their 2014 (again, without asking).** Learning and growing
8. **What were the best books you read this year?** Pretty much the only books I read were _The Fire Within_ by Chris D'Lacey and [_Storm Chase_ by K. M. Carroll](http://netraptor.org/blog/books/) (a.k.a. [NetRaptor](http://www.fanfiction.net/~netraptor) a.k.a. best thing to ever happen to Sonic fan fiction). Anyway, [I'm hoping to read more this year](http://paperairplanemob.tumblr.com/post/106646423639).
9. **With whom were your most valuable relationships?** My wife, some of my co-workers, and one of my old roommates that's living in town.
10. **What was your biggest personal change from January to December of this past year?** [I'm writing more.](http://plotholefragments.tumblr.com/)
11. **In what way(s) did you grow emotionally?** I experienced deep pain and did not die. I despaired, sure, but I lived to tell the tale.
12. **In what way(s) did you grow spiritually?** Learning—again—that God doesn't operate on my schedule.
13. **In what way(s) did you grow physically?** See, you keep asking this question, and I actually did make it up to a "healthy" BMI this year. And I got the cholesterol to go with it.
14. **In what way(s) did you grow in your relationships with others?** Learning to have empathy/compassion for jerks and bullies.
15. **What was the most enjoyable part of your work (both professionally and at home)?** Getting recognized for accomplishing something worthwhile.
16. **What was the most challenging part of your work (both professionally and at home)?** Learning to stay focused and where to direct said focus.
17. **What was your single biggest time waster in your life this past year?** I think sudoku and webcomics are tied.
18. **What was the best way you used your time this past year?** [Actually completing a challenge](http://plotholefragments.tumblr.com/30dpc) and publishing something again.
19. **What was biggest thing you learned this past year?** If I want to, I can still be as awesome as I used to be. (But maybe not as awesome as I thought I was. Because I never was.)
20. **Create a phrase or statement that describes 2014 for you.** Recovering and stabilizing from 2013.

[Brittany did this too.](http://latenightdramaqueen.tumblr.com/post/106764636751/fifth-edition) Have a great year, everyone!
