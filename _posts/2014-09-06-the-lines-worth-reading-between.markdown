Apple's latest earnings have an interesting note: [their research spending is the highest it's been since 2006][mr-rnd].

Research and development is a fancy business way of saying "doing new things." When [my previous employer][bb] entered the great recession of 2008, the plan to weather the storm was to double-down on R&D. By investing in new products when the market was slow, the company would have those products ready when the market was ready to buy. Our part of the company--tasked with entering a new market for the company--was one of the few areas allowed to hire new employees.

The economy's recovery in general is up for debate, but the advice is sound: research and development is a key investment for any company, particularly product-based companies (which any software company is, [SaaS][saas] not withstanding). It's almost too obvious: as annoying as [constant calls for Apple to release a *new* product][twi] are, they do have a point. New products and innovations are the lifeblood of these companies. Which is why every company invests in research and development.

To provide some context, simple research is a constant cost. A company sets aside a certain amount every year to pay a certain number of people to spend a certain amount of time exploring new ideas. Google is ([or at least was][end20]) famous for its "20% time" that allows any engineer in the company to spend time exploring. Microsoft has [an entire division][msresearch] devoted to exploration. Apple obviously has its own research and development; they would be unable to update their products annually without it.

When a project is close to completion, things change. Completing a project means investing in quality assurrance and testing. It means finalizing all of the little details that make the difference between a "good" product and a "great" one. What was once a fixed cost suddenly becomes more variable.

Which brings me back to the inital observation: the last time Apple's R&D spending was this high was in 2006. *Apple's most important product of the last 10 years--the iPhone--was introduced in 2007.*

By now there's [too much smoke][tms] for there not to be some kind of watch-like device from Apple, most likely to be introduced this Tuesday. And given Apple's increase in research spending, it's going to be a *big deal.*

Personally, I can't wait. You?
