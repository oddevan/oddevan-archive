I want to do all the things. I cannot. By saying publicly what I _am_ doing, I hope to be able to focus on those things.

As of October 23, 2015, I am focusing my mental energy on the following:

* Learning high-end [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) development to better prepare for projects at work
* Considering the focus going forward for oddEvan.com, particularly
  * What I've built
  * What I've analyzed
  * What I've written
  and keeping it in the past tense so that I cannot announce something to the world until I have actually done it.

There are other things, but as they are just plans, they are not on this list.
