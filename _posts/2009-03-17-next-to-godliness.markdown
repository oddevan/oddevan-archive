<p>I had a job satisfaction crisis earlier in the week. In reality it was more of a life satisfaction crisis, but a crisis of that kind is usually called a &#8220;mid-life crisis&#8221; and isn’t supposed to come until you’re 32, not 23. Besides, it wasn’t that bad. In fact, it led to a realization that, while not completely positive, is better than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088727/quotes">the depths of despair</a>.</p>



<p>This particular crisis was instigated by the realization that I’m spending a third of my time on a project that isn’t mine. I knew that going in. That’s what comes with any job where you aren’t self-employed. Duh. I figured I’d make up for it with <a href="http://www.madcrasher.com/">my</a> <a href="http://www.anticipationrecords.com/">spare</a> <a href="http://www.whumf.com/">time</a> <a href="http://windfox.whumf.com/">projects</a> like I had been doing in college. For a while I did that, and I managed to get <a href="http://www.madcrasher.com/identity/">my album out the door</a> in the process. And then it stopped.</p>



<p>Normally around this point I’d say something to the effect of ‘I have no idea why I stopped.’ But now I do. See, I’ve finally realized that I work best creatively in a clean environment. And my room is a <em>mess.</em> But logically it makes sense. Why does my room get in a mess? Because I don’t feel like I have the energy to put things in their proper place. In other words, if my life is a mess, my room is a mess. So if my room is a mess, I feel like my life is a mess and therefore cannot focus my creative energy appropriately.</p>



<p>Right now, my room is a mess. That’s about to change. Brittany, hold me to that.</p>
