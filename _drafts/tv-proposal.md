Moving away from home and going to college in the fall of 2004 brought a number of new things with it,
not the least of which was a new town. Greenville had (and still has) a number of good qualities:
lots of public green space, close proximity to mountains, and some of the best tap water in the
country. But that's not what I was excited about at first.

The local cable company had TechTV.

Technically at this point it was G4TechTV, but that was even better. I spent more hours than I care to
admit watching technical discussions on _The Screen Savers_, getting sarcastic but informative reviews
from _X-Play_, and learning about the history of games and technology from _Icons_. While a lot of it
was wasted time, I still walked away feeling more knowledgeable.

It lasted about 2 months before the network started pursuing "18-24-year-old males"[^wtf] and therefore
dumbing down--well, everything.

[^wtf]: Yes, those are sarcasm quotes.

Eventually I moved on to Discovery Channel and Food Network, each with their own elements that scratched
the same itch for knowledge. Discovery had _Mythbusters_ and the myriad of shows like it that employed
the scientific method (or at least [something close to it][xkcd-mythbusters]) to find out more of our
world. Even if the "myth" being tested was obviously just that, it was still interesting to me to learn
exactly _why._ And Food Network?

Food Network had Alton Brown.
