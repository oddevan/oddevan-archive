<p>In <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/05/06/06/1752234.shtml?tid=118&amp;tid=179&amp;tid=3">this /. story</a> Apple is reported to have officially switched to Intel processors, citing more innovation, better power use, and the fact that they&#8217;ve been planning it for the past five years. Mac OS X already runs, they&#8217;ve got a real-time emulation layer to transparently run current Mac programs, and most other programs can be rebuilt in two hours.</p>



<p>So you mean after years and years of my touting how Intel chips suxxors, now I&#8217;ve got to follow Apple onto them? <strong>groan</strong> I hope this works out. I also hope that they&#8217;re not going to sell OS X apart from Macs&#8230; or maybe that&#8217;s their plan? What better way to invade the Windows territory than to  invade their own hardware? Offer the Mac experience at a very cheap price&#8230;?</p>



<p>No, that&#8217;s not Apple&#8217;s style. The Mac experience is driven in part by the fact that hardware and software Just Workâ„¢. If Apple has to start supporting all manner of hardware that&#8217;s in the x86 world, that would cause problems. Of course, they could only support <span class="caps">ATI</span>/NVidia cards, Intel processors, and a certain kind of <span class="caps">RAM</span>&#8230; Meh, who knows. Now let&#8217;s see if I can get Tiger to run on that old HP <span class="caps">POC</span> I&#8217;ve got upstairs that won&#8217;t even run <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Red Hat&#8230;</a></p>
