<p>There's about 3 hours left in 2011 here in South Carolina. I'm probably going to do some new years survey thing in the next 24 hours or so. But for right now, I'd like to end this year. And so...</p>

<p>To everyone, my friends, my family, my co-workers, my wife, my God: I have not been all I could have been this year. I have probably let you down at some point this year, and for that I truly apologize. I don't regret this year; there have been some amazing memories and triumphs this year. But right now I'm painfully aware of my shortcomings. This hasn't been brought on by one particular thing; it's just some general depression and anxiety I'm dealing with. And right now I want nothing more than to leave all... (gestures to all of that) <em>this</em> in 2011. In the past.</p>

<p>So here's to a new leaf, a new beginning. God's grace is new every day, including tomorrow. Happy new year, everyone; I'll see you in 2012.</p>
