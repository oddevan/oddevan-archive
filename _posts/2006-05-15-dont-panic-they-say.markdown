<p>Random thoughts as I sit here at 12:42 AM doing Poly Sci work…</p>



* I’m trying not to panic. It’s just hard when you know what you have to do in order to proceed with your life as planned.
* Do you ever feel like God hates that he’s seperated from us <del>just as much as</del> <strong>more than</strong> we hate it? I’ll post this in detail later…
* I need a holiday. A very long holiday. And I don’t expect I shall return… in fact I mean not to.
* Well, I thought about the army… then I realized I was dreaming and woke up.
* teh future = <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/">Wii</a>
* There are lies, d — n lies, and statistics. And I’m doing a f — king worksheet on statistics.

<p>I need sleep. And prayer. Sleep comes later, but if you pray, can you pray for me? Thanks.</p>
