My name is [Evan Hildreth][eph], and I'm a big-picture analyst. That's not a job
description; that's my personality. I love seeing how technology and creativity intersect,
and sometimes I feel excited enough to write about it.

So, most importantly, thank you for reading.

For those who care: This site is published with [Jekyll][jekyll] running on my
[2013 MacBook Air][mba] and/or [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]. Code for the tags is courtesy
[Stephan Gro√ü][stephan]. The theme is one I wrote using [Bootstrap][bootstrap]. Headlines
and significant text are set in [Raleway][raleway].
