The FBI is not asking for a backdoor, at least not in the classic sense.

When people talk about a "backdoor" in encryption, they're talking about the digital equivalent of [TSA locks][tsa]: a lock that will open both with its individual key and a master key held by the government or a designated third party. That's not what the FBI is asking for in this particular case, so we won't discuss it here. Let's just say it works about as well in the virtual world as it does in the real world: [not][keyleak1] at [all][keyleak2].

The FBI has even clarified their stance, saying that what they are asking for is more akin to [disabling a booby trap][jd-response]. If they're not asking for a backdoor, why did [Tim Cook say they were][apl-letter]?

It's worth noting at this point that the FBI, the Justice Department, and even President Obama are coming at this from a different point of view than Apple and others in the tech world. The FBI believes strongly in the Rule of Law. And why shouldn't they? They literally exist to enforce the law of the land, to find those who break the laws and deliver the consequences. That's what they're trying to do in this situation[^optimist]: find any information possible on someone who broke the law in the interest of finding judgement. This is an admirable goal.

Apple, on the other hand, is coming from the world of technology. While laws exist in this world, 

[^optimist]: I'm assuming the best of intentions on the FBI's part. I pray that I'm not wrong.
