I'm excited about [Sling TV][sling]. It checks nearly all of my pain points with the current cable system:

[sling]: #

2. The number of channels available is limited and curated. I'm not overwhelmed by the sheer number of channels available.
3. It's built for modern viewing habits where a subscription is tied to a person, not a residence.
4. It's the closest we're going to get to a-la-carte cable. The current cable channel market is built around bundling channels, and it's going to take a long time before that changes. Sling works now by making the bundles as small as possible. If you're looking to add one channel (besides HBO) to Sling's basic lineup, the most you'll pay to do that is $5, and you might get some other channels with it.
5. In the months since the service has been announced and active, it has added channels fairly consistently.
6. No contracts. 'Nuff said.
1. Most importently to me, Sling's regular, non-promotional rate is both clearly published and affordable. Compare this with [the local phone company (who we currently subscribe to)][uverse] that has expensive non-promotional rates and [the local cable monopoly][charter] that makes non-promotional rates next to impossible to find. Since Sling doesn't have promotional rates, I know I wouldn't be missing out on a better deal by not calling the cancellation department and haggling for a better rate.

These are all problems that Sling is solving now. While I'm sure Sling would love to have a-la-carte channels, they've worked within the system to build a service that is available throughout the United States. And it's available now. Not "by the end of 2015." Not "sometime in 2016." *Now.*

I emphasize this because of [the unannounced, unconfirmed Apple television service.][atv] I'm not going to use the word "delayed" here since there simply has been no announcement. Apple doesn't like to announce products until they're ready, and for good reason: they take time.

[atv]: #

Apple knows that a product is useless until people can actually use it. An idea is just that: an idea. And right now, if this Apple TV service does exist, it's only an idea. Current rumors put the delays on Apple wanting broadcast networks available in the service, an aspiration that can quickly turn into a quagmire given the sheer number of local network affiliates.
