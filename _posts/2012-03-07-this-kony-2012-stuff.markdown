<p>Having kept track of or been involved with <a href="http://invisiblechildren.com/">Invisible Children</a> in one way or another since 2006, I'm excited to see <a href="http://vimeo.com/37119711">their latest video</a> getting so much attention.</p>

<p>Having kept track of or been involved with Invisible Children in one way or another since 2006, it's easy for me to believe <a href="http://visiblechildren.tumblr.com/">the recent accusations against them</a>.</p>
