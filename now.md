I want to do all the things. I cannot. By saying publicly what I _am_ doing, I hope to be able to focus on those things.

As of October 23, 2015, I am focusing my mental energy on the following:

* Learning high-end [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) development to better prepare for projects at work
* Considering the focus going forward for oddEvan.com, particularly keeping things in the past tense (so I can't talk about things I _plan_ on doing but only things I've already _done_).
* [Destiny](https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/254/9093158)

There are other things, but as they are just plans, they are not on this list.
