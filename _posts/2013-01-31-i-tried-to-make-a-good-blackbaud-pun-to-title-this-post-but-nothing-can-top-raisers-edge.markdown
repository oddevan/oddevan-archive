<p>Today was my last official day at Blackbaud. Never you mind that I haven’t done any work for them since I got the news <a href="http://www.oddevan.com/post/40622024531" target="_blank">two and a half weeks ago</a>. I knew a lot of great people there, and I will miss working with all of them.</p>

<p>I want to be clear right now: there are no hard feelings on this end. Maybe someday later I’ll post some navel gazing and tell all of you in Internet-land just how I’m feeling right now, but suffice it to say this is a beginning, not an ending. I’m chasing down some leads here in the Greenville area, but if you know of anything that fits <a href="http://eph.me/resume" target="_blank">my resume</a> please get in touch.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking about working at Blackbaud and you’ve ended up here by some happenstance, let me tell you to <strong>give them a shot.</strong> The people you work with and report to make or break your experience, and all of the managers I’ve worked under have been great. They’ve congratulated me on successes, given me a push when I needed it (and I have needed several), and taken an interest in me as a person, not just an asset. They have set a high standard for anyone else I will be working for.</p>

<p>So now we get to wade elbow-deep in the cesspit that is free-market insurance (until I get a full-time job). It’s not as bad as I was afraid it would be, but it still leaves much to be desired. I’m finishing up my <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/book/ios_programming_the_big_nerd_ranch_guide_rd_edition_" target="_blank">iOS self-study program</a>; no idea when I’ll get an app in the store, though you can bet I’ll post here when I do. All that to say, to those that have supported us, thanks. We’re ok, but we might ask for help. In the form of cookies.</p>

<p>My God is so big…</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href="http://www.blackbaud.com/altru">Altru</a>: no faults. (Thanks, Brittany!)</p>
