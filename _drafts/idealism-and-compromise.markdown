In 1985 Richard M. Stallman, fed up with the growing tendency for software to be sold as an unmodifiable black box, published the [GNU Manifesto][gnu-m], a document detailing a computer system that would respect the freedom and intelligence of programmers everywhere. [Maria Bustillos at _The New Yorker_ wrote an excellent article commemorating the 30 year anniversary of the document.][bustillos] In it, she describes her interactions with many modern programmers:

> When I asked around about [Stallman], many people spoke of him as one might of a beloved but eccentric and prickly uncle. They would roll their eyes a bit, then hasten to add, as more than one did, “But he’s _right_ about most things.”

I am firmly in this camp. I've written [a rebuttal to one of Stallman's articles][filesharing] before, and I will often take to the comments of [Hacker News][hn] with my (in my mind) more moderate approach to being a modern developer. Though, after accidentally inciting a flame war with [what I thought was a well-measured comment][hn-comment], perhaps I need to re-examine my position on things.
