title: This Is Not Okay
---
I hate conflict. Partly because I'm a people pleaser with an unhealthy need for everyone to like me.

I look at events like [Ferguson, MO][ferguson]. I want things to fit into my comfortable narrative of police being good guys and only responding with appropriate force against bad guys. That's not what happened, by any measure. I want to believe that racism on this scale doesn't happen in my country. It does. I want to believe that any citizen in this country can trust that their public servants truly want to serve and protect them. But I can't.

It's become increasingly clear to me that the events in Ferguson are not isolated or unusual, and that is not okay.

I look at events like the recent kerfluffle over women in gaming. I've seen a few of [Feminist Frequency][femfreq]'s videos and think they're well-reasoned. In looking at any creative work critically, one must examine it from all angles; the point of Anita's videos is to call an often-ignored angle into focus. It's why every video says in its description:

> Remember that it is both possible (and even necessary) to simultaneously enjoy media while also being critical of itâ€™s more problematic or pernicious aspects.

If games are to be taken seriously as "art," then perspectives like Anita's should be taken seriously. [That's not what happened.][backlash]
