<p>Thoughts while recovering from my first self-made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screwdriver_cocktail">screwdriver:</a></p>


* I can’t tell if I made it stronger or weaker; the lack of ice ruined my frame of reference. Don’t worry, both the OJ and the <a href="http://www.smirnoff.com/">vodka</a> were chilled.
* Drinking it from a coffee mug is so much more college kid than a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highball_glass">high ball glass.</a>
* Buying from <a href="http://www.totalwine.com/">Total Wine</a> is a pain if you’re exactly 21 (like I am). They have to xerox your drivers license and get you to fill out a form. Every. Freaking. Time.
* You need the drink to get though the first two thirds of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/">Hot Fuzz,</a> after that, the explosions kick in.
* Despite the hassle, I’ll probably go back to Total Wine. Four shots worth of vodka there is cheaper than one screwdriver at <a href="http://www.brixxpizza.com/">our usual hangout.</a>

<p>Next on the list: Black Cherry Vodka and… what? Give me some suggestions!</p>
