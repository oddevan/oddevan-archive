<p>Apple didn’t sue Samsung because they had a touchscreen phone. They didn’t sue because of rounded rectangles. They didn’t sue because of icons arranged in a grid.</p>

<p>Palm added all those together to get WebOS, which was easily distinguishable from iOS.</p>

<p>Microsoft added all those together (save rounded corners) to get Windows Phone 7, which was easily distinguishable from iOS.</p>

<p>Google added all those together and made the Nexus series of Android-powered phones that were easily distinguishable from iOS-powered iPhones.</p>

<p>Samsung added all those things together and arranged them to be <em>as similar to the iPhone as possible.</em> They ignored advice from Google warning them not to do so. Instead of pouring creative effort into <em>improving</em> on what iOS had to offer, they focused on <em>copying</em> what iOS had to offer.</p>

<p><strong>That</strong> is why Apple took then to court, and that is why they lost.</p>
