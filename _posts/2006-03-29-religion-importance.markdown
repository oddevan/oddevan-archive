<p>Okay, I know there are lies, d**n lies, and statistics, but here’s some interesting statistics I found in this program we had to get for Poly Sci class:</p>



* 77.4% of Americans consider religion to be an important part of their lives.
* 84.1% – 85.3% of Americans consider the Bible to be the word of God (47.2% – 55.5% claim room for interpretation)
* 41.6% consider themselves to be strongly religious people, with 42.8% not so strong.

<p>So, it’s safe to say that the vast majority of people in America consider religion to be somewhat important. <strong>So why are we so afraid to talk about it?</strong></p>



<p>I’m throwing down the gauntlet now: if you want to break the silence and tell the world what you believe, my microphone is open. I don’t care if you’re Islamic, Hinduist, Buddhist, Agnostic, Christian, or a follower of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, I want to hear it. The only thing I care about is that you believe it.</p>
