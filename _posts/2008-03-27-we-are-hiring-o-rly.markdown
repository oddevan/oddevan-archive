<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a> I am going to bring the smack to this unsolicited e-mail I was just sent because some company is trolling <a href="http://www.monster.com/">a popular job search website.</a></p>



<blockquote>

		<p>Hi, my name is Andrew W. King and I am the President of United American’s Branch Office Division.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I believe we have a winner for the &#8220;Most Obscure Yet Oddly Professionally Sounding Name Of A Company&#8221; award!</p>



<blockquote>

		<p>I found your resume online and wanted to contact you.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>If this wasn’t an obvious form letter, I’d appreciate that. But it is, so I don’t.</p>



<blockquote>

		<p>We are now hiring applicants from a wide variety of backgrounds and we believe you are an outstanding match.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>In other words, I have a pulse.</p>



<blockquote>

		<p>We have immediate openings for motivated individuals like you.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>You could tell I was motivated just by my resume? Then you obviously didn’t catch that I’m living at my parents’ house.</p>



<blockquote>

		<p>First year earnings can range as high as $100,000 for new representatives and management positions are <strong>awarded</strong> for excellence, regardless of prior experience.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>So, if I &#8220;award&#8221; you the award mentioned above, will you &#8220;award&#8221; me a management position?</p>



<blockquote>

		<p>If you are goal-oriented with good communication skills and have a desire to succeed within a company that has a well-known industry reputation for financial stability, quality products and streamlined services, then I would like to speak with you at your earliest convenience.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Rule Number One for Evan: <strong>NO <span class="caps">SALES</span> <span class="caps">POSITIONS</span></strong> I’m sorry, but this is not negotiable. Unless you’re <a href="http://jobs.apple.com/index.ajs?BID=2&amp;Language=en&amp;CountryId=3&amp;method=mHvexternal.showPositionDetails&amp;PID=88">Apple</a>.</p>



<blockquote>

		<p>We are a part of the Torchmark Corporation.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Found them. Do not want. I mean… really do not want.</p>



<p>Moral of the story: don’t spam. You’re wasting the time I could have spent trolling <a href="http://charleston.craigslist.org/web/">craigslist</a>.</p>
