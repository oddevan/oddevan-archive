title: RetroPie for NOOBS
---
The [Raspberry Pi][rpi] is one of the coolest things to happen to hobbyist computing in a long time. It's a small computer with a few USB ports (for a keyboard and whatever else you might need), HDMI output (for most modern monitors or televisions), and a stack of general-purpose input/output pins (for literally anything else a computer can do). The whole thing is about the size of a credit card (unfortunately a bit larger than an [Altoids tin][altoids]), is powered by a cellphone charger, and costs around $35 USD.

Because of its small size and utility, the Pi can be used for [any number of small-computer applications][rpiprojects]. I haven't quite decided on one thing, and thankfully, I don't have to. The Rasperry Pi associaion recently released a new system called [NOOBS][noobs], or "New Out-Of-Box Software". In addition to making generating a new memory card for the Pi easier than ever (no command line!), it provides a simple system for loading multiple operating systems and changing them on a whim. The result is that when I turn on my Pi, I can decide to boot into [a normal operating system][raspbian], [a media center][raspbmc], [a different media center][rasplex], or even a retro gaming station.
