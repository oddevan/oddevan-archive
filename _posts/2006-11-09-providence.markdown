<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://www.oddevan.com/main.php/archives/136/nano-update-day-eight/">last night’s update,</a> Dustin, my <span class="caps">RUF</span> minister here at Furman, was airlifted to the hospital yesterday evening. Apparently his bike locked up — tripped on a rock or something — and threw him headfirst onto the ground. Eventually they had to take him into surgery for brain swelling. As of right now he’s stable but in a <del>medically-induced</del> coma until the swelling stops.</p>

<p>It’s kind of scary, really. I’ve barely known the guy for two-and-a-half months and now I’m faced with the possibility of losing him. At the very least, brain injuries like this are known to cause personality changes. Sometimes they’re mild, sometimes they’re extreme. Either way, he’s not going to be the same person coming out than he was going in. It’s sobering, especially considering I’ve grown to like his animated, over-the-top, write-five-words-on-every-page-and-turn-the-page-every-two-seconds preaching style.</p>

<p>But the kicker here is this: this past Sunday he preached at <a href="http://www.redeemerchurch.net/">Redeemer</a> on the providence of God. How no matter what God is in control despite our best efforts. And that’s really all I can count on right now. I’m trying to pray, but — to be perfectly honest — my prayer life is f — ed up right now. And all I can count on is that 1) God knows what He’s doing, and 2) God doesn’t love me because of the things I do, or because I act a certain way. The only reason God would even pay attention to me is Jesus.</p>

<p>And now that I think about it, that’s all that’s ever true.</p>

<p>So God, if you’re reading my blog, please remind us all that You are in control, not us.</p>
