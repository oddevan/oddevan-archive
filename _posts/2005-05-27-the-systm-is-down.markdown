<p>Okay, if you’re into technology, you really should check out <a href="http://www.kevinrose.com/">Kevin Rose’s</a> new downloadable show <a href="http://www.systm.org/">Systm.</a> This first episode is about building a warspying device, basically a box with a screen and a receiver for wireless cameras (like the X10 camera that shows up in pop-up ads the world over). It’s a pretty cool show, especially for being free.</p>



<p>Another reason I’m saying this is that Kevin recently <a href="http://krose.typepad.com/kevinrose/2005/05/hello_world.html">quit his day job</a> at <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/">some television channel</a> to do this. Given the direction that network is headed (the $igns are everywhere), I’m kinda glad he’s jumping ship now, although <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/aots">Attack of the Show</a> won’t be nearly the same without him. Good luck, Kevin. And I want to interview you for <a href="http://bsod.root-1.com/">bsod!</a></p>
