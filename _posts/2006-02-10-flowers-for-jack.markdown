<p>I <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/02/07/flowers-for-jack-part-deux/2#c1014420">left a note for Jack Thompson</a> over at <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/">Joystiq</a> that he&#8217;ll probably never read, though I&#8217;ve heard he goes there every-so-often.<br />
<blockquote><span class="caps">STOP</span> <span class="caps">CALLING</span> <span class="caps">YOURSELF</span> A <span class="caps">CHRISTIAN</span>, <span class="caps">JACK</span> <span class="caps">THOMPSON</span>.</p>

<p>Yes, I was one of the signers of the letter (though I was too cheap to donate anything). I disagree with much of what you&#8217;re saying, but that&#8217;s beside the point. I&#8217;m not angry because I disagree with you.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m angry because you are knowingly distorting information and &#8220;bearing false witness&#8221; against those that ordered flowers. If you would take the time to read the letter you would realize that the flowers were simply to get your attention. It was believed that you would appreciate flowers better than sex toys, copies of <span class="caps">GTA</span>, or pizzas you didn&#8217;t order. Apparently we were wrong.</p>

<p>Jack Thompson, it is my firm belief that by proclaiming God to be on your side in this battle is defaming the name of God (Exodus 20:7), similar to those who proclaim that &#8220;God Hates Fags.&#8221; You are associating the name of God with a message of hate. I am not saying God does not hate sin. He does, but he does not hate sinners. He sent Jesus for sinners.</p>

<p>I realize I have not been very coherent in this post. I would love to dialogue with you further on this (an e-mail form can be reached from my website). However, since you seem to have mocked our request for a civil forum with you (see the <span class="caps">FFJ</span> letter), I don&#8217;t hold much hope for that. In fact, I doubt you will read this at all. You&#8217;ve probably already written me off as a damned Pixelante, not bothering to notice that I, and many others, hold the same Faith you claim to have.</p>

<p>In Christ,</p>

I had to get that off my chest. Sorry.</p>
