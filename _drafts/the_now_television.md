About a year ago, I wrote [an article speculating what the television landscape could look like 5-10 years from now][newtv]. In that article, I didn't address the possibility of an "internet cable" company, where a company offers a service nearly indistinguishable from traditional cable but delivered over the internet. [I asked about such a company on Quora once,][quora] and the response was basically, "Even if you won the lottery, you couldn't do this." So I considered it impossible and dismissed it.

[Then the impossible happened.][introducing-sling]
