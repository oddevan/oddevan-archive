This comment really took the cake, though:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>If “Christians” wanted to make this world a better place, they’d immediately either denounce their religion or kill themselves.

I don’t care if you went to church every single day of your life; that doesn’t mean you know anything about it. Let’s look at things logically here:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>“If “Christians” wanted to make this world a better place, they’d immediately either denounce their religion or kill themselves.”</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, there <strong>are</strong> true Christians out there that are actively trying to make the world a better place. <a href=\"http://www.worldvision.org/\">WorldVision</a> is a good place to start. And if we all took your advice and killed ourselves, you’d just look at us and say, “Wow, look at all those idiots who killed themselves.” Cults have mass suicides. Christianity doesn’t. In fact, if you actually read the Bible, you’d see that Jesus brought someone back from the dead.

I’ve appreciated John McCain’s willingness to go against the party establishment the past few years, a reason I’ll be voting for <a href=\"http://lgraham.senate.gov/\">our current senator</a> as well. On the other hand, Barack Obama appears to have a <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/29/the-techcrunch-tech-president-endorsements-barack-obama-and-john-mccain/\">solid technology platform</a> and it’s undoubtable that he’s inspired a lot of people to take interest in politics.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, I want to make an informed decision and choose the candidate that aligns most closely with what I believe. Now, <a href=\"http://www.reformed.org/documents/apostles_creed.html\">my most closely held beliefs</a> may or may not be held by the candidates; in today’s political environment it’s almost impossible to tell what beliefs are genuine. (Not completely impossible, mind you, but <a href=\"http://www.mikehuckabee.com/\">those guys</a> don’t typically win, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjYv2YW6azE\">endorsements</a> or not.) As far as political beliefs go, it’s sometimes hard for me to tell just <strong>what</strong> I believe. Less government spending is good, abortion is bad, morals in general are kinda… not sure. After this policy and that boycott, I’m wondering how right the &#8220;Christian right&#8221; really is.</p>\n\n<p>Sounds like a job for… a political quiz! Or rather, several.

I’ve appreciated John McCain’s willingness to go against the party establishment the past few years, a reason I’ll be voting for <a href=\"http://lgraham.senate.gov/\">our current senator</a> as well. On the other hand, Barack Obama appears to have a <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/29/the-techcrunch-tech-president-endorsements-barack-obama-and-john-mccain/\">solid technology platform</a> and it’s undoubtable that he’s inspired a lot of people to take interest in politics.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, I want to make an informed decision and choose the candidate that aligns most closely with what I believe. Now, <a href=\"http://www.reformed.org/documents/apostles_creed.html\">my most closely held beliefs</a> may or may not be held by the candidates; in today’s political environment it’s almost impossible to tell what beliefs are genuine.

As far as political beliefs go, it’s sometimes hard for me to tell just <strong>what</strong> I believe. Less government spending is good, abortion is bad, morals in general are kinda… not sure. After this policy and that boycott, I’m wondering how right the &#8220;Christian right&#8221; really is.</p>\n\n<p>Sounds like a job for… a political quiz! Or rather, several.

I really do. I mean, seriously, withdraw from any ATM, get unlimited checks, deposit from your computer, earn interest. They even offer cash back rewards for using your debit card. So what's the <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/watch/73150/30-rock-preach-it-liz-lemon\">dealbreaker</a>? The fact that Ally is the bank arm of GMAC, the former financing arm of General Motors. Feature-wise, they're awesome, but their bailout status doesn't inspire much confidence.</p>\n\n<h3>The Mom and Pop: <a href=\"http://www.cpmfed.com/\">CPM Federal Credit Union</a></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interest:</strong> with $200 minimum balance</li>\n<li><strong>Free Checks:</strong> 3 boxes per year</li>\n<li><strong>Free ATM Usage:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.co-opfs.org/\">Co-Op Network</a></li>\n<li><strong>Branches:</strong> a few</li>\n<li><strong>Online Tools:</strong> Barely</li>\n<li><strong>Deposit Options:</strong> Branch</li>\n<li><strong>Bailout Received / Returned:</strong> none</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've already got a savings account (and therefore a membership) with CPM, and they've been nothing but helpful. I've got no qualms about the financial stability of the organization; my hesitations lie in my ability to use them for my day-to-day banking and the quality of their online tools. They're contenders.</p>\n\n<h3>The Bundle: <a href=\"http://www.usaa.com/\">USAA</a></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interest:</strong> with $1000 minimum balance</li>\n<li><strong>Free Checks:</strong> unlimited</li>\n<li><strong>Free ATM Usage:</strong> 10 visits/month, refund $15/month in fees</li>\n<li><strong>Branches:</strong> none</li>\n<li><strong>Online Tools:</strong> excellent</li>\n<li><strong>Deposit Options:</strong> Mail, UPS Store, Scanner and iOS app (if insurance customer or have credit card)</li>\n<li><strong>Bailout Received / Returned:</strong> none</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>USAA insurance is like an exclusive club. The company was formed to support armed services personnel and their families, which I respect. I received my eligibility from my parents who received their eligibility from their parents who were in the military. We currently use them for auto insurance, and every conversation with every other insurance salesperson has died as soon as they found out. It's that good.</p>\n\n<p>Why the long story? The best features of the USAA bank (deposit from iOS app) are only available to insurance and credit card customers. This wouldn't be an issue, except that we may soon be forced to change insurance companies due to South Carolina becoming the equivalent of e.coli-infested raw meat in the insurance world<sup id=\"fnref-81:ins\"><a href=\"#fn-81:ins\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>. However, the ability to make deposits at a UPS store almost makes up for this.</p>\n\n<h3>The Unexpected: <a href=\"http://www.statefarm.com/bank/bank.asp\">State Farm Bank</a></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interest:</strong> with $2500 minimum balance</li>\n<li><strong>Free Checks:</strong> first box</li>\n<li><strong>Free ATM Usage:</strong> unlimited</li>\n<li><strong>Branches:</strong> none</li>\n<li><strong>Online Tools:</strong> yes</li>\n<li><strong>Deposit Options:</strong> Scanner, iOS app, Mail</li>\n<li><strong>Bailout Received / Returned:</strong> none</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Did you know State Farm had a bank? Yeah, neither did I. And feature-for-feature, they're not half bad. They've got unlimited where it counts (ATM usage), though their conditions for interest are a little high. It's hard to judge their online tools; the glimpse I was able to see wasn't particularly impressive. If we for sure wanted an online bank, they'd be a serious contender, but as it there's just not enough info out there.</p>\n\n<h3>The Tuxedo: <a href=\"http://www.scbtonline.com/\">South Carolina Bank and Trust</a></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interest:</strong> yes</li>\n<li><strong>Free Checks:</strong> none</li>\n<li><strong>Free ATM Usage:</strong> unlimited SCBT, refund 3/month out-of-network</li>\n<li><strong>Branches:</strong> a few</li>\n<li><strong>Online Tools:</strong> yes</li>\n<li><strong>Deposit Options:</strong> Branch</li>\n<li><strong>Bailout Received / Returned:</strong> $65M/$65M</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is the current frontrunner. They offer interest with all of our prerequisites and they have an option for using other banks' ATMs. They've only got a few branches in the area, and only one of them is convenient, and even it is hard to get to (on the second floor of an office building with no clear direction). They did receive TARP funds, but it's less than 1/100th of what Bank of America got and it was all paid back. Most impressive to me is their graphic design on their brochures and web site: it's clean, fresh, and classy. While money is not made with marketing alone, the fact is they care about their image more than other banks on this list, and that speaks volumes to me about the kind of approach they take to customer service.</p>\n\n<p>That said, there are some misgivings. The 3 other ATM visits per month is never actually found on their website; that information came from the tellers at the bank. Being able to talk to someone in person is a great asset, but is having one fairly inconvenient branch that much better than having no branches at all? And while their TARP funding is significantly less than most other banks in the area, the fact that it seemed necessary is (only a little) disconcerting.</p>\n\n<h3>The Wildcard: <a href=\"http://www.simple.com/\">Simple</a></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interest:</strong> yes</li>\n<li><strong>Free Checks:</strong> ???</li>\n<li><strong>Free ATM Usage:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.allpointnetwork.com/\">Allpoint network</a></li>\n<li><strong>Branches:</strong> none</li>\n<li><strong>Online Tools:</strong> Yes. Very yes.</li>\n<li><strong>Deposit Options:</strong> iOS app</li>\n<li><strong>Bailout Received / Returned:</strong> n/a</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you haven't heard of Simple (formerly BankSimple), get on the internet. Their approach is a little different: instead of holding your money, they act as a services company that gives you (extremely convenient) access to your money stored at a \"partner bank.\" You still get FDIC insurance, and all your interactions are with Simple; the difference is more technical than practical. So far, they look beautiful. They promise to have a superior online experience, including being able to see your \"safe to spend\" balance at a glance.</p>\n\n<p>So why the wildcard? Simply put, there's a lot we don't know. They haven't launched to the public yet, and their website is scarce on details. No word on their partner bank, and it appears that they'll be using the Allpoint ATM network though that's not explicitly mentioned on their website.<sup id=\"fnref-81:apatm\"><a href=\"#fn-81:apatm\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> No idea on paper checks (will you have to mail them from the site or can you order them?). One thing that <em>is</em> mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.simple.com/faq/#other\">their FAQ</a> is that they currently do <em>not</em> support joint accounts, which kind of kills the idea a married couple using it.</p>\n\n<h3>What does it mean?!</h3>\n\n<p>Not sure. Like I said, this is a comparison based on our market and with our specific needs. If you're facing a similar decision, I hope you can use this as a jumping-off point for your own research. If you have any issues, addendums, or comments of your own, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:oddevan@shortmail.com\">send me an email</a>. Personally, I still have high hopes for Simple, but they can't be a contender until the service matures and gains credibility. To their credit, they know that and aren't opening the service up until they get things straight.

However, the ability to make deposits at a UPS store almost makes up for this.</p>\n\n<h3>The Unexpected: <a href=\"http://www.statefarm.com/bank/bank.asp\">State Farm Bank</a></h3>\n\n<ul>  \n<li><strong>Interest:</strong> with $2500 minimum balance</li>  \n<li><strong>Free Checks:</strong> first box</li>  \n<li><strong>Free ATM Usage:</strong> unlimited</li>  \n<li><strong>Branches:</strong> none</li>  \n<li><strong>Online Tools:</strong> yes</li>  \n<li><strong>Deposit Options:</strong> Scanner, iOS app, Mail</li>  \n<li><strong>Bailout Received / Returned:</strong> none</li>  \n</ul>\n\n<p>Did you know State Farm had a bank? Yeah, neither did I. And feature-for-feature, they're not half bad. They've got unlimited where it counts (ATM usage), though their conditions for interest are a little high. It's hard to judge their online tools; the glimpse I was able to see wasn't particularly impressive. If we for sure wanted an online bank, they'd be a serious contender, but as it there's just not enough info out there.</p>\n\n<h3>The Tuxedo: <a href=\"http://www.scbtonline.com/\">South Carolina Bank and Trust</a></h3>\n\n<ul>  \n<li><strong>Interest:</strong> yes</li>  \n<li><strong>Free Checks:</strong> none</li>  \n<li><strong>Free ATM Usage:</strong> unlimited SCBT, refund 3/month out-of-network</li>  \n<li><strong>Branches:</strong> a few</li>  \n<li><strong>Online Tools:</strong> yes</li>  \n<li><strong>Deposit Options:</strong> Branch</li>  \n<li><strong>Bailout Received / Returned:</strong> $65M/$65M</li>  \n</ul>\n\n<p>This is the current frontrunner. They offer interest with all of our prerequisites and they have an option for using other banks' ATMs. They've only got a few branches in the area, and only one of them is convenient, and even it is hard to get to (on the second floor of an office building with no clear direction). They did receive TARP funds, but it's less than 1/100th of what Bank of America got and it was all paid back. Most impressive to me is their graphic design on their brochures and web site: it's clean, fresh, and classy. While money is not made with marketing alone, the fact is they care about their image more than other banks on this list, and that speaks volumes to me about the kind of approach they take to customer service.</p>\n\n<p>That said, there are some misgivings. The 3 other ATM visits per month is never actually found on their website; that information came from the tellers at the bank. Being able to talk to someone in person is a great asset, but is having one fairly inconvenient branch that much better than having no branches at all? And while their TARP funding is significantly less than most other banks in the area, the fact that it seemed necessary is (only a little) disconcerting.</p>\n\n<h3>The Wildcard: <a href=\"http://www.simple.com/\">Simple</a></h3>\n\n<ul>  \n<li><strong>Interest:</strong> yes</li>  \n<li><strong>Free Checks:</strong> ???</li>  \n<li><strong>Free ATM Usage:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.allpointnetwork.com/\">Allpoint network</a></li>  \n<li><strong>Branches:</strong> none</li>  \n<li><strong>Online Tools:</strong> Yes. Very yes.</li>  \n<li><strong>Deposit Options:</strong> iOS app</li>  \n<li><strong>Bailout Received / Returned:</strong> n/a</li>  \n</ul>\n\n<p>If you haven't heard of Simple (formerly BankSimple), get on the internet. Their approach is a little different: instead of holding your money, they act as a services company that gives you (extremely convenient) access to your money stored at a \"partner bank.\" You still get FDIC insurance, and all your interactions are with Simple; the difference is more technical than practical. So far, they look beautiful. They promise to have a superior online experience, including being able to see your \"safe to spend\" balance at a glance.</p>\n\n<p>So why the wildcard? Simply put, there's a lot we don't know. They haven't launched to the public yet, and their website is scarce on details. No word on their partner bank, and it appears that they'll be using the Allpoint ATM network though that's not explicitly mentioned on their website.<sup id=\"fnref-81:apatm\"><a href=\"#fn-81:apatm\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> No idea on paper checks (will you have to mail them from the site or can you order them?). One thing that <em>is</em> mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.simple.com/faq/#other\">their FAQ</a> is that they currently do <em>not</em> support joint accounts, which kind of kills the idea a married couple using it.</p>\n\n<h3>What does it mean?!</h3>\n\n<p>Not sure. Like I said, this is a comparison based on our market and with our specific needs. If you're facing a similar decision, I hope you can use this as a jumping-off point for your own research. If you have any issues, addendums, or comments of your own, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:oddevan@shortmail.com\">send me an email</a>. Personally, I still have high hopes for Simple, but they can't be a contender until the service matures and gains credibility. To their credit, they know that and aren't opening the service up until they get things straight. And it didn't take <a href=\"http://squareup.com/\">Square</a> long to get to the same point.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">  \n<hr />  \n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn-81:ins\">  \n<p>USAA is not writing new property insurance (renters and homowners) policies in South Carolina unless you are a military family. Took me several phone calls to find that out; their website was unhelpful and so were the first 3 people I talked to. We eventually went with Allstate for renters insurance, but when it came time to get a homowners policy, guess what? They're only writing new policies in SC if you have car insurance with them. See above note on how awesome USAA car insurance is. We eventually went with State Farm, but in order to lower our deductable we need to get car insurance with them as well.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-81:ins\" rev=\"footnote\">&#8617;</a></p>  \n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn-81:apatm\">  \n<p>The Simple website uses the phrases \"largest nationwide ATM network\" and \"40,000 ATMs\" multiple times.

In this case, it was how my fear of approaching women and my general personality and just absolutely everything about me was going to mean that I was not going to find my wife at college even though most people do and that meant I was never going to find a wife in general and so on.</p>\n\n<p>So I went down to the lake to pray.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I say \"pray,\" you should read \"talked and sometimes yelled out loud at God because there was no one else to listen.\" It was more than a little irreverent, but it was what I needed. I poured out everything: how anxious I was about the future, how I was afraid that even if God brought the right person into my life I'd be too stupid to notice her, how lonely I was, and how afraid I was that I'd always be lonely. And while I didn't hear a voice, my thoughts went in a direction that was completely different from where they were going.</p>\n\n<p>In that moment, it was like God took the scared, freaking out child that I was, took him gently by the shoulders, knelt down, looked him in the eyes, and said, \"Evan, I have been watching out for you your entire life. Why would I stop now, especially on something that is this important to you?\"</p>\n\n<p>I was still scared. But a lot less freaked out. And—spoiler alert—<a href=\"http://nerdflavor.com/brittany\">I found her</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This week, I've been skirting the edge of depression (maybe more than skirting, to be honest) and worrying about the future. In this particular case, <a href=\"http://oddevan.com/post/42000058713\">I've been without a job for three months now</a>. I've been searching and interviewing, and I've been subject to the usual delays and pitfalls of a job search. Despite my relative success at keeping myself busy with <a href=\"http://pilltimer.oddevan.com/\">a nice side project</a>, I've been giving into panic more than I care to admit. The part of my brain that I should never listen to (yet always do) is yelling again about how much trouble my future is in. In this case, it's how my lack of what I perceive as a robust background is going to mean I can't get a job and if I do get a job is it going to be one that I will enjoy and not just show up to and will I really be able to do the job if I do get it and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Time to go down to the park to pray, but somehow I don't think the message has changed.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1367084386000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1367084386000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1367084386000,"published_by":1},{"id":35,"uuid":"cafa1d7b-641c-4254-a787-8750d6420dd0","title":"Why Apple Should Not Buy Nintendo","slug":"why-apple-should-not-buy-nintendo","markdown":"<p>They really shouldn't. I want to set expectations up front, and when you're talking about either Apple or Nintendo, people (myself included) are going to have Opinions. But let's back up a bit first.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The ideal</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A good merger is one where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. By that, I mean that the two companies coming together amplify each other's strengths and compensate for each other's weaknesses.<sup id=\"fnref-190:marriage\"><a href=\"#fn-190:marriage\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> The best mergers will emphasize the second more than the first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let's look at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT#1996:_After_NeXT\">Apple-NeXT merger in 1996</a> as an example of a successful merger. NeXT was a small company that made what they considered to be the best operating system in the world, NeXTSTEP. Their computer, the NeXTcube, was used for a variety of advanced computer uses, most notably by Tim Berners-Lee to create <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb\">the first web server and web browser</a>. They also had Steve Jobs, arguably one of the best business leaders in the industry. By 1996, though, they had dropped their hardware division and were only selling their software to run on conventional PCs as a replacement for Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple at this time was in trouble. They made what they considered to be the best computers in the world, but they were lagging behind in the software race. They had tried and failed to develop <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland_(operating_system)\">their own modern operating system</a>, and were in serious danger of losing the personal computer market to Windows 95. Their management was unfocused and unable to bring the different factions within Apple to work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple and NeXT shared the common goal of making the best products they could. NeXT had a solid operating system but couldn't convince people to give up Windows to use it. Apple had strong hardware but their software hadn't evolved enough to take advantage of that hardware. At its core, the merger brought the two companies together on their common goal, with Apple supplying the hardware NeXT needed and NeXT supplying the software and management Apple needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end result? The immediate change with Apple was the influx of good management from NeXT, particularly Steve Jobs. The software team at Apple immediately began work on newer versions of the existing Mac OS (versions 8 and 9) that bought Apple enough time to get the new, NeXTSTEP-based Mac OS out the door as Mac OS X. The advanced operating system not only improved performance on Apple's existing hardware, but allowed them to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%27s_transition_to_Intel_processors\">switch to a completely different type of hardware</a> when they needed to. On top of that, OS X was versatile enough that Apple would eventually <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS\">use it to power the iPhone and iPad</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 15 years later, that $400 million investment is still paying off. <em>That's</em> a good merger.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The reality</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So where are Apple and Nintendo today? What are their strengths and weakness that would make-or-break our hypothetical merger?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple of today prides itself on a--dare I say it--<em>magical</em> marriage of hardware and software. The design ideal is that when you see their work, whether hardware or software, it is beautiful; but when you need to actually do work, the hardware and software become almost invisible compared to what you are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Apple has traditionally not been good at games. Not many people know of their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Bandai_Pippin\">attempt at making a game console with Bandai</a>, and for good reason: it wasn't good. Gaming on the Mac has always been a second-class citizen, and companies like <a href=\"http://www.valvesoftware.com/games/\">Valve</a> have only begun targeting the Mac <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/about/\">in the past few years</a>. Games are very popular on iOS devices, but those games are not significantly tied to iOS itself. As <a href=\"http://stratechery.com/2013/casual-gaming-is-a-sustainable-business-but-not-a-platform-differentiator/\">Ben Thompson writes</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <ul>\n\n  <li>Games take over the whole screen; this means that tailoring a game to fit a particular platform’s look and feel isn’t important</li>\n\n  <li>There is an entire industry devoted to providing cross-platform compatibility from day one. Most game developers are targeting game engines such as <a href=\"http://unity3d.com/\">Unity</a>, not iOS or Android. This is acceptable because of point one</li>\n\n  </ul>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo is committed to making the best gaming experiences possible, then making them better. In the past, this has led them to create some of the most beloved franchises in the video game world, including Super Mario, Zelda, Kirby, and Pok&eacute;mon. In recent years, this has meant pursuing new hardware: not only the gyroscope for the Wii and the touchscreen for the DS but also things like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DK_Bongos\">DK Bongos for the GameCube</a>, the microphone for the DS, and the stereo camera on the 3DS. For every hardware feature Nintendo releases, there is a game like <em>Wii Sports</em>, <em>WarioWare</em>, or <em>Donkey Konga</em> designed specifically to get the most fun from that feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current Nintendo is a victim of a changing landscape. They lost mindshare and marketshare of hobbyist<sup id=\"fnref-190:hardcore\"><a href=\"#fn-190:hardcore\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> gamers to Sony and Microsoft, and their (smart) response was to pursue the mainstream market with the Wii and DS. This strategy paid off until iOS and Android devices began capturing mindshare and marketshare in the mainstream with free-to-play casual games among other benefits. Their efforts to woo both markets with the Wii U and 3DS have been decent, but some worry <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-02/nintendo-seen-missing-target-as-sony-microsoft-sales-dwarf-wii-u.html\">it won't be enough to keep the company around</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The dream</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what happens if we bring the two companies together? Let's assume for the sake of argument that Apple uses some of its cash horde and buys Nintendo outright.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From day one, Apple has a large library of exclusive games for its platform, games that are fun and that people want to play; and Nintendo is essentially guaranteed a place in the new smartphone world. Nintendo can, with some effort, create versions of classic games from its library for iOS, accessable to a massive audience that would easily pay the current asking prices of $3-5 each. These games would obviously not be available for any other smartphone or tablet platform, increasing the value of iOS both to consumers who want to play Nintendo games and to developers who want to reach those consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going forward, Nintendo can help Apple to move its platform forward much like they have with their own platforms in the past. Possibilities dreamed up by the iOS platform team can be made concrete by Nintendo's game team. Both companies thrived in the past by pushing the integration of hardware and software, and having both companies push each other could bring out the absolute best in both. If Apple does release an app-capable Apple TV <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2013/02/13/xbox-founding-engineer-says-apple-tv-could-destroy-console-gaming-with-third-party-apps/\">as rumored</a>, a library of Nintendo games would only help sell the device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let's not leave hardware out of the equation. A Jony Ive-designed game console would be great for publicity, but Nintendo could gain more immediate benefits from Apple's supply chain. Apple has incredible buying power when it comes to quality components, especially solid-state storage and touch screens. A (relatively) quick update to the 3DS and Wii U touch screens would elevate the quality of those devices, and that is an area that Apple has made itself an expert in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, of course, assumes there are no cultural issues with the merger. Part of what made the Apple-NeXT merger so successful was the understanding that NeXT management was essentially taking over Apple. If the hardware or software teams at the two companies aren't able to find common ground with each other, the best talent could walk out the door and the resulting company would be far worse off than either company would have been separate. This could be a moot point; desperation on either side has a way of forcing compromise where it wasn't thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that's not why I think it wouldn't work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The problem</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best mergers amplify shared strengths and compensate for weaknesses. The worst mergers amplify shared weaknesses. And Apple and Nintendo share a similar weakness: online services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Apple's biggest competetors moving forward is Google. Google was born on the web, and as such, Google understands the web on a near-instinctual level. Servers talking to servers talking to phones is a beginning requirement for a product, not an idea tacked on halfway through the process. More importantly, they know how people use the web. They know how many people leave if <a href=\"http://www.google.com/think/articles/the-google-gospel-of-speed-urs-hoelzle.html\">search slows down less than half a second</a>. They know how to give users <a href=\"http://mail.google.com/\">email</a>, <a href=\"http://drive.google.com/\">file storage</a>, <a href=\"http://docs.google.com/\">online document editing</a>, and keep it all in sync. Apple's previous online service, MobileMe, <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20080723/apples-mobileme-is-far-too-flawed-to-be-reliable/\">was not well received</a>. Their new service, iCloud, is an attempt to modernize the service and make it more reliable, but <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/29/apples-icloud-disparaged-over-core-data-sync-problems\">the reality falls short of the ideal</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Nintendo's biggest competitors moving forward is Microsoft. The Xbox is a powerful game machine on its own, but its biggest strength is the Xbox Live service. Every Xbox Live game ties into the same online infrastructure, allowing individual players to define their friends once (using easy-to-remember names) and play with them in every game. <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/11/11/4849940/xbox-live-millennium-e\">This is something Microsoft has fought for from the beginning of the service.</a> Most importantly, the interactions and purchases in Xbox Live are defined around people. Contrast this with Nintendo, which bases its interactions around devices. Social connections are made by exchanging device-specific <a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/wfc/en_na/ds/gameSupportFriendCodes.jsp#manual\">friend codes</a> which have all the joy and personality of 16-digit phone numbers. Purchases and friend lists are device-dependent, so replacing a console outside of a warranty repair means <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/5982965/nintendo-fan-is-unhappy-with-nintendos-200-answer-to-his-400-wii-u-problem\">losing your entire library of downloaded games</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing all this, how appealing does it sound to know that the company that brought you <em>MobileMe</em> is merging with the company that brought you <em>friend codes</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, both Apple and Nintendo are learning in this area. Apple's iCloud service is getting better, but it will be some time before developers (and their users) begin to trust the service. Nintendo is slowly making improvements to their online service, but they would still rather <a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/UHQZFP2Jxcll_Vm-PsZpxNIK5920bRRK\">shut down a service than see it misused</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both companies, still approach the internet the same way they approach products: slowly and deliberately. This often leads to them missing a crucial component of what their customers <em>actually want</em>. A merger would make this worse, not better, as companies (just like people) lean on what they know during times of transition. A merger would deny both companies the opportunity to truly learn and understand online services in the modern, connected world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which stinks because I really want to play Pok&eacute;mon on my iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n\n\n\n<li id=\"fn-190:marriage\">\n\n<p>It's a lot like marriage in that regard, but that's a topic for another day.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-190:marriage\" rev=\"footnote\">&#8617;</a></p>\n\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li id=\"fn-190:hardcore\">\n\n<p>Some places call them \"hardcore\" or \"serious\" gamers, but the basic idea is people who pursue gaming like most people pursue hobbies: investing more time and money than average and knowing more about the subject than most people.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-190:hardcore\" rev=\"footnote\">&#8617;</a></p>\n\n</li>\n\n\n\n</ol>\n\n</div>\n\n","html":"<p>They really shouldn't.

If we take the assumption that television will move online at face value,<sup id=\"fnref1\"><a href=\"#fn1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> what options could a television viewer have 5-10 years from now?\n<h3>The New HBO: Netflix</h3>\nNetflix is leading the way in premium online video, both in marketshare and mindshare. They see themselves as maintaining this premium brand, and <a href=\"http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm\">their long-term manifesto</a> specifically mentions having a top-tier viewing experience, including no commercials.\n\nToday, if you ask people what the best channel on cable is, they’ll probably say “HBO,” even if they don’t subscribe. Everyone knows HBO is where high-quality television like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Game of Thrones</span> and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">True Detective</span> is shown. Likewise, if you ask people where the best online video is, they’ll probably say “Netflix,” thanks to original shows like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">House of Cards</span> and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Orange Is the New Black</span>.\n\nNetflix has the market share now, and they’re also doing everything they can to stay foremost in people’s minds when it comes to television. I don’t see them losing this position as more and more video services pop up; their huge head start in content and technology should keep them in the lead. Provided, of course, <a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/netflix-abandons-plan-to-rent-dvds-on-qwikster/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\">they don’t do anything stupid</a>.\n<h3>The New Showtime: HBO</h3>\nThe first name people think of in premium television today is HBO, but the second is Showtime. They win their fair share of awards and attention with shows like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Dexter</span> and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Homeland</span>; but they’re usually thought of in the same sentence as HBO, not on their own. This is the place I see HBO occupying: excellent in their own right, but always in relation to Netflix.\n\nThis doesn’t seem like it should happen. HBO is part of <a href=\"http://www.timewarner.com/our-content/home-box-office\">a much larger corporate behemoth</a> and has had many profitable years of existence to build its content abilities. Also, according to numbers from <a href=\"http://www.snl.com/sectors/Media/Default.aspx\">SNL Kagan</a>, HBO’s wholesale price (the price paid to HBO after the cable company takes its cut) is around the same price as Netflix’s price to its end users. In other words, if HBO were to instantly switch to a direct-to-customer model, they would only need to match Netflix on price to bring in the same revenue.\n\nI see two major obstacles for HBO going forward. The first is their ties to the cable industry and the status quo. While the current system allows them to arbitrarily raise their prices without immediately alerting the end-users (a problem <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/09/netflix-learns-from-past-mistakes-increases-prices-the-right-way/\">Netflix is running into</a>), it also ties them closer to the existing pay-TV market and gives them less time to establish themselves firmly in the streaming market. The second problem is that their current forays into the streaming market have been met with technical glitches at <a href=\"http://www.heavy.com/tech/2014/03/true-detective-finale-causes-hbo-go-crash-outage/\">the worst possible times</a>. Normally for a tech-savvy media company, the technical problems are easy and the content problems are hard, but at the scale HBO would need to operate to compete on Netflix’s own turf, the technical problems are quite hard and could impact HBO’s bottom line more than they realize.\n<h3>The New Network: Hulu</h3>\nNetwork television is often decried for being bland, unoriginal, and all-around mainstream. But what every television hipster (of which I am one) knows in their heart is that this is where the eyeballs are. It used to be that broadcast television–and by extension network TV–was the only way to reach most Americans. Today, cable’s audience has grown to the extent that massive audiences are possible for shows like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Breaking Bad</span>, but the original networks still command a powerful presence in the television world.\n\nHulu is most known for making that network TV readily available to internet viewers. Viewers can easily catch the last couple of episodes of their favorite network dramas and late-night talk shows for free on their computers as long as they are willing to tolerate a few commercials to do so. They also offer a premium service, <a href=\"http://huluplus.com/\">Hulu Plus</a>, that allows access to more episodes and shows as well as allowing viewing through smartphones, tablets, and set-top boxes. Unlike Netflix and HBO, however, <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/support/article/20356372\">Hulu Plus still contains commercials</a>. While this seems antithetical to a premium service, it is practically no different than nearly every single channel available on cable.\n\nI expect Hulu to continue to invest in its original programming, much like HBO and Netflix. Its focus on network-style programming gives it the ability to become the next mainstream-focused network. It remains to be seen, however, whether its decision to keep advertisements in its subscription offering will affect its ability to keep subscribers over the long term.\n<h3>The New ESPN: ESPN</h3>\nESPN describes themselves as “the worldwide leader in sports,” and they have done their best to live up to that description, especially when it comes to online video. ESPN has offered live events via their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN3\">ESPN360</a> website since 2007, relaunching it as ESPN3 in 2010. ESPN3 is not a free service, however, as it is only available to internet users whose service providers have agreed to pay ESPN for access to the service. This is in addition to ESPN’s recently launched video platform, appropriately titled <a href=\"http://watchespn.com/\">WatchESPN</a>. Similar to HBO GO, this service is only available to subscribers of participating cable providers.\n\nOther major sports providers, like <a href=\"http://stream.nbcsports.com/liveextra/\">NBC</a> and <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsportsgo/\">FOX</a>, have their own streaming video websites and apps. Unlike ESPN, however, these are relatively recent developments, and ESPN’s head start in building out its live streaming infrastructure shows. Throw in ESPN’s overwhelming mindshare in sports broadcasting, and they won’t be going anywhere in the new television world.\n<h3>The New Cable: TV Everywhere</h3>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Everywhere\">TV Everywhere</a> is an initiative by the existing cable/satellite companies to tie online streaming to existing cable subscriptions. For example, to use the March Madness app to watch the NCAA Men’s Basketball tournament, you must be an existing cable subscriber to watch any game not broadcast on CBS.\n\nIn the future, it’s not hard to imagine a “virtual cable” operator that has access to these apps as its primary service as opposed to a secondary add-on. This service probably wouldn’t be any cheaper than existing cable, but it could easily compete in other aspects such as ease-of-use, customer service, and a general awareness of its place in the new world that other cable providers would not have.\n\nSo why is this listed separately from HBO and ESPN? In actuality, it’s not that different, and those channels could easily be part of this “virtual cable” company. The difference with HBO and ESPN is the simple fact that those channels have the sheer brand power to break away from cable. It’s unlikely that TBS or Animal Planet could sell their channels outside of a bundle, but HBO and ESPN have such strong brands that not only could they easily sell access to their apps on their own, they could break their existing cable contracts to do so and not lose many (if any) cable affiliates in the process since no cable company wants to offer a service without those channels.\n<h3>So what?</h3>\nNothing, really. While I could see a lot of these things playing out as I proposed here, anything can change when there’s technology involved. The mythical Apple Television (separate from or a reboot of the current <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/appletv/\">Apple TV</a>) could be just as game-changing as everyone wants it to be. Netflix could have another Quikster moment or find that its original content strategy is unsustainable. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU\">The ongoing net neutrality debate</a> could actually affect things.\n\nThere’s a lot of what-ifs ahead in the world of television, but personally, I can’t wait to see what happens.\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n\t<li id=\"fn1\">I know I’m asking a lot here. The incumbent providers, many of whom own channels, will do everything they can to protect the status quo. But let’s face it, saying “everything will stay the same because the de facto monopolies given to the current television providers allow them to prevent this future at all costs” is about as interesting as <a href=\"http://eldorion.com/lore/eagles/\">sending the eagles to Mordor</a>. <a href=\"#fnref1\" rev=\"footnote\">↩</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","html":"<p>It was a little over a year ago that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings laid out their strategy:  </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"large\">“The goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.”</blockquote>  \n\n<p>I would argue that this has happened. <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/21/netflix-q3-40-million-total/\">They’ve surpassed HBO in number of (paying) subscribers</a>, essentially proving the market for streaming internet television separate from a traditional pay TV (cable, satellite, IPTV) subscription.</p>\n\n<p>So let’s have some fun.

Also, according to numbers from <a href=\"http://www.snl.com/sectors/Media/Default.aspx\">SNL Kagan</a>, HBO’s wholesale price (the price paid to HBO after the cable company takes its cut) is around the same price as Netflix’s price to its end users. In other words, if HBO were to instantly switch to a direct-to-customer model, they would only need to match Netflix on price to bring in the same revenue.</p>\n\n<p>I see two major obstacles for HBO going forward. The first is their ties to the cable industry and the status quo. While the current system allows them to arbitrarily raise their prices without immediately alerting the end-users (a problem <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/09/netflix-learns-from-past-mistakes-increases-prices-the-right-way/\">Netflix is running into</a>), it also ties them closer to the existing pay-TV market and gives them less time to establish themselves firmly in the streaming market. The second problem is that their current forays into the streaming market have been met with technical glitches at <a href=\"http://www.heavy.com/tech/2014/03/true-detective-finale-causes-hbo-go-crash-outage/\">the worst possible times</a>. Normally for a tech-savvy media company, the technical problems are easy and the content problems are hard, but at the scale HBO would need to operate to compete on Netflix’s own turf, the technical problems are quite hard and could impact HBO’s bottom line more than they realize.  </p>\n\n<h3>The New Network: Hulu</h3>  \n\n<p>Network television is often decried for being bland, unoriginal, and all-around mainstream. But what every television hipster (of which I am one) knows in their heart is that this is where the eyeballs are. It used to be that broadcast television–and by extension network TV–was the only way to reach most Americans. Today, cable’s audience has grown to the extent that massive audiences are possible for shows like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Breaking Bad</span>, but the original networks still command a powerful presence in the television world.</p>\n\n<p>Hulu is most known for making that network TV readily available to internet viewers. Viewers can easily catch the last couple of episodes of their favorite network dramas and late-night talk shows for free on their computers as long as they are willing to tolerate a few commercials to do so. They also offer a premium service, <a href=\"http://huluplus.com/\">Hulu Plus</a>, that allows access to more episodes and shows as well as allowing viewing through smartphones, tablets, and set-top boxes. Unlike Netflix and HBO, however, <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/support/article/20356372\">Hulu Plus still contains commercials</a>. While this seems antithetical to a premium service, it is practically no different than nearly every single channel available on cable.</p>\n\n<p>I expect Hulu to continue to invest in its original programming, much like HBO and Netflix. Its focus on network-style programming gives it the ability to become the next mainstream-focused network. It remains to be seen, however, whether its decision to keep advertisements in its subscription offering will affect its ability to keep subscribers over the long term.  </p>\n\n<h3>The New ESPN: ESPN</h3>  \n\n<p>ESPN describes themselves as “the worldwide leader in sports,” and they have done their best to live up to that description, especially when it comes to online video. ESPN has offered live events via their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN3\">ESPN360</a> website since 2007, relaunching it as ESPN3 in 2010. ESPN3 is not a free service, however, as it is only available to internet users whose service providers have agreed to pay ESPN for access to the service. This is in addition to ESPN’s recently launched video platform, appropriately titled <a href=\"http://watchespn.com/\">WatchESPN</a>. Similar to HBO GO, this service is only available to subscribers of participating cable providers.</p>\n\n<p>Other major sports providers, like <a href=\"http://stream.nbcsports.com/liveextra/\">NBC</a> and <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsportsgo/\">FOX</a>, have their own streaming video websites and apps. Unlike ESPN, however, these are relatively recent developments, and ESPN’s head start in building out its live streaming infrastructure shows. Throw in ESPN’s overwhelming mindshare in sports broadcasting, and they won’t be going anywhere in the new television world.  </p>\n\n<h3>The New Cable: TV Everywhere</h3>  \n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Everywhere\">TV Everywhere</a> is an initiative by the existing cable/satellite companies to tie online streaming to existing cable subscriptions. For example, to use the March Madness app to watch the NCAA Men’s Basketball tournament, you must be an existing cable subscriber to watch any game not broadcast on CBS.</p>\n\n<p>In the future, it’s not hard to imagine a “virtual cable” operator that has access to these apps as its primary service as opposed to a secondary add-on. This service probably wouldn’t be any cheaper than existing cable, but it could easily compete in other aspects such as ease-of-use, customer service, and a general awareness of its place in the new world that other cable providers would not have.</p>\n\n<p>So why is this listed separately from HBO and ESPN? In actuality, it’s not that different, and those channels could easily be part of this “virtual cable” company. The difference with HBO and ESPN is the simple fact that those channels have the sheer brand power to break away from cable. It’s unlikely that TBS or Animal Planet could sell their channels outside of a bundle, but HBO and ESPN have such strong brands that not only could they easily sell access to their apps on their own, they could break their existing cable contracts to do so and not lose many (if any) cable affiliates in the process since no cable company wants to offer a service without those channels.  </p>\n\n<h3>So what?</h3>  \n\n<p>Nothing, really. While I could see a lot of these things playing out as I proposed here, anything can change when there’s technology involved. The mythical Apple Television (separate from or a reboot of the current <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/appletv/\">Apple TV</a>) could be just as game-changing as everyone wants it to be. Netflix could have another Quikster moment or find that its original content strategy is unsustainable. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU\">The ongoing net neutrality debate</a> could actually affect things.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a lot of what-ifs ahead in the world of television, but personally, I can’t wait to see what happens.  </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>  \n    <li id=\"fn1\">I know I’m asking a lot here. The incumbent providers, many of whom own channels, will do everything they can to protect the status quo. But let’s face it, saying “everything will stay the same because the de facto monopolies given to the current television providers allow them to prevent this future at all costs” is about as interesting as <a href=\"http://eldorion.com/lore/eagles/\">sending the eagles to Mordor</a>. <a href=\"#fnref1\" rev=\"footnote\">↩</a></li>\n</ol>  \n</div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1402186262000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1403305870735,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1402186262000,"published_by":1},{"id":39,"uuid":"ddad3553-e34f-46a0-bf52-74951296c4e3","title":"About","slug":"about","markdown":"<p>My name is <a href=\"http://eph.me/\">Evan Hildreth</a>, and I'm a big-picture analyst.

Completing a project means investing in quality assurrance and testing. It means finalizing all of the little details that make the difference between a &ldquo;good&rdquo; product and a &ldquo;great&rdquo; one. What was once a fixed cost suddenly becomes more variable.</p>\n\n<p>Which brings me back to the inital observation: the last time Apple&rsquo;s R&amp;D spending was this high was in 2006. <em>Apple&rsquo;s most important product of the last 10 years&ndash;the iPhone&ndash;was introduced in 2007.</em></p>\n\n<p>By now there&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/?q=apple+iwatch+too+much+smoke\">too much smoke</a> for there not to be some kind of watch-like device from Apple, most likely to be introduced this Tuesday.

It has the added benefit of making it easy to set up the Pi to boot multiple operating systems. Here's how to convert a RetroPie SD Card image to a NOOBS-compatible image.\n\n_These instructions are largely based on the instructions for creating a custom OS image on [the NOOBS GitHub repository](https://github.com/raspberrypi/noobs#how-to-create-a-custom-os-version)_\n\nYou will need read access to all partitions of the flashed SD card. While RPi's instructions imply they can be followed directly from the Pi itself, you may be able to find plugins for your primary computer's operating system to allow read access to the ext-formatted partition of the SD card. This will allow you to use the full power of your computer to create the compressed disk image and probably save you hours.\n\nFor OS X users, [here is a tutorial for mounting the filesystem](http://osxdaily.com/2014/03/20/mount-ext-linux-file-system-mac/), and you can install the `tar` and `xz` commands using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).\n\n1. [Download the latest RetroPie image][retropiedownload] and [flash an SD card (or other volume) with it][flashsd]\n2. [Download the latest NOOBS release.][noobsdownload] You will need the full NOOBS download (not NOOBS Lite) since we will be using the included Raspbian image as a base.\n3. While that downloads, write down the full sizes of the two partitions on the RetroPie SD card ('boot' and 'retropie' as of this writing). You will need them later. (OS X users: type `diskutil list` at the command line to get this easily.)\n4. Create the `.tar` file of the main RetroPie filesystem (the 'retropie' partition). From the command line on your primary computer, navigate to where the 'retropie' partition is mounted (on OS X, try `cd /Volumes/retropie`). The command is `tar -cvpf ~/Desktop/retropie.tar ./*` and this will create the `retropie.tar` file on your desktop.\n5. Write down the size of `retropie.tar`.\n6. Navigate to your desktop (or wherever you saved the tarball) with `cd ~/Desktop/` and compress the tarball with the command `xz -9 -e retropie.tar`. This will take some time.\n7. Now we need to do the same thing to the 'boot' partition, but `tar` apparently doesn't like FAT-formatted volumes. So... Copy the contents of the 'boot' partition to a folder on your hard drive. I used `~/Desktop/rpi/boot`.\n8. From the command line, navigate to the 'boot' folder you just created. The command is `tar -cvpf ~/Desktop/boot.tar ./*` and this will create the `boot.tar` file on your desktop.\n9. Write down the size of `boot.tar`.\n10. Navigate to your desktop (or wherever you saved the tarball) with `cd ~/Desktop/` and compress the tarball with the command `xz -9 -e boot.tar`. This won't take long, not nearly as long as the 'retropie' tarball.\n11. Hopefully NOOBS has finished downloading by now. Unzip it, and open up the 'os' folder. Duplicate the 'Raspbian' folder and rename it 'RetroPie'.\n12. Open up 'partitions.json' in your favorite (or second-favorite) text editor and make the following changes:\n\t1. Change the `label` on the `root` partition to read `retropie`.\n    2. Change the value for `parition_size_nominal` for both `boot` and `retropie` to be the values from step 3 in megabytes. Since this is used by NOOBS to determine how much space will be on the SD card after install, it's better to round up than down. (Ex: a 59.8 MB partition would have a value of 60. A 1.9 GB partition would have a value of around 2000.) \n    3. Change the value for `uncompressed_tarball_size` to be the values from step 5 and 9\n13. Throw out 'flavours.json'. We don't need it.\n14. Open 'os.json' in whatever text editor is handy and make the following changes:\n\t1. Change `name` to `RetroPie`\n    2. Change whatever else you want. At the very least you should probably change `url` to `http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/` to provide proper credit to the awesome people who put this project together!\n15. Rename 'Raspbian.png' to 'RetroPie.png' and replace it with an appropriate icon.\n16. Replace any or all of the files in the 'slides_vga' folder with approporiate images. These will be shown during the install process.\n17. Replace the 'boot.tar.xz' and 'root.tar.xz' with the 'retropie.tar.xz' and 'boot.tar.xz' files you created in steps 6 and 10.\n18. Format and prepare an SD card as described in the [NOOBS Setup Guide][nsg]. RetroPie should be available as an option in the OS list next to Raspbian.\n19. _Profit!_\n\n[retropiedownload]: http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/retropie-downloads/\n[flashsd]: http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup\n[noobsdownload]: http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/\n[nsg]: http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/","html":"<p><a href=\"http://raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/\">NOOBS</a> is an easy way to set up an SD card for a Raspberry Pi.

This will take some time.  </li>\n<li>Now we need to do the same thing to the 'boot' partition, but <code>tar</code> apparently doesn't like FAT-formatted volumes. So... Copy the contents of the 'boot' partition to a folder on your hard drive. I used <code>~/Desktop/rpi/boot</code>.  </li>\n<li>From the command line, navigate to the 'boot' folder you just created. The command is <code>tar -cvpf ~/Desktop/boot.tar ./*</code> and this will create the <code>boot.tar</code> file on your desktop.  </li>\n<li>Write down the size of <code>boot.tar</code>.  </li>\n<li>Navigate to your desktop (or wherever you saved the tarball) with <code>cd ~/Desktop/</code> and compress the tarball with the command <code>xz -9 -e boot.tar</code>. This won't take long, not nearly as long as the 'retropie' tarball.  </li>\n<li>Hopefully NOOBS has finished downloading by now. Unzip it, and open up the 'os' folder. Duplicate the 'Raspbian' folder and rename it 'RetroPie'.  </li>\n<li>Open up 'partitions.json' in your favorite (or second-favorite) text editor and make the following changes: <br />\n<ol><li>Change the <code>label</code> on the <code>root</code> partition to read <code>retropie</code>.</li>\n<li>Change the value for <code>parition_size_nominal</code> for both <code>boot</code> and <code>retropie</code> to be the values from step 3 in megabytes. Since this is used by NOOBS to determine how much space will be on the SD card after install, it's better to round up than down. (Ex: a 59.8 MB partition would have a value of 60. A 1.9 GB partition would have a value of around 2000.) </li>\n<li>Change the value for <code>uncompressed_tarball_size</code> to be the values from step 5 and 9</li></ol></li>\n<li>Throw out 'flavours.json'. We don't need it.  </li>\n<li>Open 'os.json' in whatever text editor is handy and make the following changes: <br />\n<ol><li>Change <code>name</code> to <code>RetroPie</code></li>\n<li>Change whatever else you want. At the very least you should probably change <code>url</code> to <code>http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/</code> to provide proper credit to the awesome people who put this project together!</li></ol></li>\n<li>Rename 'Raspbian.png' to 'RetroPie.png' and replace it with an appropriate icon.  </li>\n<li>Replace any or all of the files in the 'slides_vga' folder with approporiate images. These will be shown during the install process.  </li>\n<li>Replace the 'boot.tar.xz' and 'root.tar.xz' with the 'retropie.tar.xz' and 'boot.tar.xz' files you created in steps 6 and 10.  </li>\n<li>Format and prepare an SD card as described in the <a href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/\">NOOBS Setup Guide</a>. RetroPie should be available as an option in the OS list next to Raspbian.  </li>\n<li><em>Profit!</em></li>\n</ol>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1421618625245,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1421696312659,"updated_by":1,"published_at":null,"published_by":null}],"users":[{"id":1,"uuid":"c5c0fb5c-df09-4389-9cad-d16873dce100","name":"Evan
