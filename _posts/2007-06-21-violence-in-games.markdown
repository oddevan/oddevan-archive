<p>If you haven’t heard about all the to-do about Manhunt 2, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_2">wikipedia page</a> has a nice summary. Basically, someone made an <strong>extremely</strong> violent game, got an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board#Current">Adults Only</a> rating from the <span class="caps">ESRB</span>, which makes it against company policy for it to be stocked at most major retailers or played on the major game consoles. What follows is my thoughts from <a href="http://www.nintendowiifanboy.com/2007/06/21/wii-warm-up-if-gamers-are-aging-should-ao-games-be-okay/">this discussion at Wii Fanboy.</a></p>

<p>I don’t have a problem with people making AO games or buying AO games as long as they are of the proper age. However, I fully respect the right of the major retailers to not stock the games. Best Buy, Target, and the like don’t carry NC-17 movies (do they?), so it makes sense that they won’t carry AO games. There’s plenty of opportunities for small, specialty retailers to carry the games.</p>

<p>As for Nintendo and Sony refusing to license the games, it’s their decision. They’re not entering this decision lightly; with all the hype this game is getting, licensing this game is like money in the bank. But if they want to keep their platform at a certain level, that’s their decision.</p>

<p>And folks, please please <strong><span class="caps">PLEASE</span></strong> don’t call this ‘banning‘ the game or ‘censorship‘. The government is not involved here and no one’s going to jail. These are decisions by private corporations; no one is being forced to not carry Manhunt 2.</p>

<p>I think the core problem is that video games are still fighting for acceptance as an art form. Games like this won’t be acceptable until after that happens, not before. Games like this–unfortunately–will do more to <strong>hurt</strong> games’ acceptance than help it.</p>
