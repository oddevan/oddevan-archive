title: You Just Gestured To All Of Me

I'm going to go ahead and say it: _How To Train Your Dragon_ is one of my favorite movies of all time.

Let's start with the premise: Hiccup is the nerdy, adorkable, creative kid that gets picked on by everyone around him. His dad doesn't understand him and calls him a disappointment. His friends... don't exist. His peers take cheap shots at him and make fun of him to his face. All he wants is to be accepted by everyone, but given his physical stature, the odds of him gaining said acceptance are pretty low.

By the way: he's a viking, and their village is regularly attacked by dragons.

Despite the otherworldly setting, we instantly relate to Hiccup. His dry, sarcastic wit (thanks in no small part to [Jay Baruchel][JB]'s excellent voice acting) and social-outcast status identify him as the underdog in this story, and we love to root for the underdog. Within the first ten minutes, thanks to his narration, we have a general idea of the conflict (Vikings v. dragons), the love interest (Astrid), and Hiccup's unique approach to said conflict (sort of like a crossbow, except for a bola).

**Movie rating: A+**
