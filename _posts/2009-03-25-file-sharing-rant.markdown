<p><i>I’ve largely taken a back seat on the whole file sharing debate. However, now that I actually have <a href="http://www.madcrasher.com/identity/">a self-published work</a> I feel it is time for me to make a public stance. Here goes…</i></p>



<p>I’m going to have to agree with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/03/23/stallman-trap">John Gruber’s assessment</a> of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">Richard Stallman’s latest essay</a>:</p>



<blockquote>

		<p>I waver between rolling my eyes at Stallman’s kookiness and admiring his singleminded determination.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>In my case, however<sup class="footnote" id="fnrev1641153250525ad54a494d2"><a href="#fn1641153250525ad54a494d2">1</a></sup>, Stallman’s kookiness extends to a large portion of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">Free Software Foundation’s philosophies</a>. Above all else, the <span class="caps">FSF</span> champions the right to modify and redistribute software. I have no problem with this goal as I will often promote a free or <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source</a> program (which apparently <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">are not the same</a>) when it is a <em>viable</em> alternative to a commercial program. I use <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> instead of <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a>. I use <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The <span class="caps">GIMP</span></a> instead of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/family/?promoid=BPDEK">Photoshop</a>. But I use <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari">Safari</a> instead of <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> because I find Safari to be faster on my Mac. In my case, I am willing to give up a &#8220;freedom&#8221; that I don’t really use (the ability to modify the source code) in exchange for a more pleasant computing experience.</p>



<p>It is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061105211448/http%3A//www.linuxp2p.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=10771">Richard Stallman’s opinion on creative works</a> that I find unacceptable<sup class="footnote" id="fnrev791373206525ad54a4e30f"><a href="#fn791373206525ad54a4e30f">2</a></sup>. Never mind that because not <em>all</em> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses are free he refuses to endorse <em>any</em> of them (he, of course, suggests the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"><span class="caps">GPL</span></a>). What is dangerous is that he equates creative works such as movies and music with information and file sharing with the general term &#8220;sharing.&#8221; In doing so, Stallman shows his background as a computer scientist. A program is written to solve a problem; the FSF’s arguments that there are more benefits to releasing the source are valid here largely because the program can benefit from the scientific method. Information wants to be free, and the solution to the problem (the program) is simply another form of information.</p>



<p>A creative work, however, is not simply information. It does not consist of simple facts or present a solution to an established problem. It is, when done properly, a reflection of the author or artist’s heart. It can be anything from <a href="http://adisney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/wall-e/">a commentary on society</a> to <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2066325/1/">a rewrite of a poorly done movie</a> to <a href="http://free.napster.com/player/tracks/13080226">an attempt to reconcile temporal existence with eternal life</a>. As such, creative works cannot be held to the same standards as computer programs, and vice versa.</p>



<p>Equating creative works to information reduces the author’s creative expression to its digital format, an act of language that cheapens the work even more than <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Content">the term content</a>. And distributing digital creative works over file sharing is not simply sharing, it is <em>copying.</em> Like anything distributed over the internet, the digital information is copied, not moved, from one computer to another. Loaning a CD or a book to a friend is sharing, since while one is in possession of it the other is not. File sharing creates copies, so that both are in possession at the same time. While not necessarily the same as theft, this cannot, by any reasonable definition, be considered sharing.</p>



<p>This is not to say I am against file sharing as a whole. There are hundreds of out-of-print and hard-to-find works that can benefit from file sharing in order to preserve their value to society. Also, it can be used by <a href="http://www.madcrasher.com/">lesser known artists</a> to encourage the viral word-of-mouth growth that is essential to growing a fanbase. This is the aim of Creative Commons, and I am disappointed that a man committed to &#8220;freedom&#8221; refuses to acknowledge the benefits of such a system.</p>
