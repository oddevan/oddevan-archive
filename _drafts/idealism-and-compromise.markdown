In 1985 Richard M. Stallman, fed up with the growing tendency for software to be sold as an unmodifiable black box, published the [GNU Manifesto][gnu-m], a document detailing a computer system that would respect the freedom and intelligence of programmers everywhere. [Maria Bustillos at _The New Yorker_ wrote an excellent article commemorating the 30 year anniversary of the document.][bustillos] In it, she describes her interactions with many modern programmers:

> When I asked around about [Stallman], many people spoke of him as one might of a beloved but eccentric and prickly uncle. They would roll their eyes a bit, then hasten to add, as more than one did, “But he’s _right_ about most things.”

I am firmly in this camp. I've written [a rebuttal to one of Stallman's articles][filesharing] before, and I will often take to the comments of [Hacker News][hn] with my (in my mind) more moderate approach to being a modern developer. Though, after accidentally inciting a flame war with [what I thought was a well-measured comment][hn-comment], perhaps I need to re-examine my position on things.

### Freedom is good ###

Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation are most known for a legal contract: the [GNU General Public License][gpl]. This creative use of copyright law (described as "copyleft") ensures that computer programs released under its terms will always be free to use, share, and modify. These terms extend to the entirety of programs that contain GPL-licensed code. Software that adheres to these terms is considered "Free Software" by Stallman and the FSF; the "free" in this case is in a philosophical sense, similar to "freedom of speech."

[gpl]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

The most well-known GPL-licensed program is the operating system Linux. This operating system is running on most of the servers that power modern websites and is the basis of the smartphone operating system Android. Because it is covered by the GPL, the [source code for Linux][kernel] is freely available for anyone to download.

[kernel]: https://www.kernel.org

Despite this restriction, there is plenty of money to be made with Linux and other Free Software projects. The usual approach is to give away the code (as required) but sell support and services around the software. [Red Hat Software][rh] made waves in the late 90's dot-com boom by openly declaring the Free nature of their software yet still making money; they provide professional support, maintenance, and consulting services for Linux. A more consumer-facing company is [Automattic][matt], maintainers of the blogging software [WordPress][wp]. While anyone knowledgable enough can download and run WordPress on their own server, many companies will pay to have Automattic set up and maintain a WordPress server for them.

### Code free or die ###

//stuff about gpl and ios? game engines?

[In my earlier rant][filesharing2], I expressed disappointment in Stallman and the FSF for diminishing the value of creative work.

//don't value design
// entirety of program must be open sourced, including graphical assets? soundtrack?
//piracy real problem, people are tone deaf

### Idealism and compromise ###

So all that to say, I stand by my original comment. I make many compromises as a developer. I enjoy programming for the closed platform iOS, and I am willing to sacrifice some freedom as a developer in order to do so.
